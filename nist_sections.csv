No
Partially

Alternative Approach
Do you document information flow control enforcement by using protected processing level (e.g., defensive architecture) as a basis for flow control decisions? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information The solutions may include firewalls, proxies, encryption, and other security technologies. Information flow control regulates where information can travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.
Examples of flow control restrictions include:
• keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet,
• blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization,
• restricting web requests to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and
• limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. The company may consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example:
• prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only),
• employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and
• implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security label. Companies commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Companies may also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/ inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.

Do you only grant enough privileges to users to allow them to do their job? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Does the company restrict access to privileged functions and security information to authorized employees? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional information: The principle of least privilege requires that every process, user, or program can only access the information and resources that are needed for its valid purpose. The principle of least privilege means giving a process, program, or user account only those privileges that are essential for it to perform its intended function. When applied to users, the term least-privileged user account (LUA) is also used. Meaning all user accounts should always run with as few privileges as possible, and launch applications with as few privileges as possible. Where to Look:

Alternative Approach
 Can this be described or demonstrated? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Are users with privileged access required to use non-privileged accounts when accessing other system functions? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information This requirement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where companies implement access control policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account. Note that the privileged account should not be used to do non-privileged functions. NIST SP 800-171 defines a “privileged user” as “a user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.” For example, if users’ computer accounts are “administrator accounts” or have “limited administrative rights” only on their computers, are they considered a “privileged account” requiring audit for privileged functions? Since, in this case, the “ordinary users” are authorized to perform the function, they are not considered privileged users. Where to Look:

Additional Information System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. Companies may consider system use notification messages/ banners displayed in multiple languages based on specific company needs and the demographics of information system users. This requirement references the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) Federal Rule 32 CFR 2002 implementing its CUI program. It applies if a specific type of CUI (i.e., information that requires safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to law, regulation or Government-wide policy) requires such notices (e.g., before accessing or entering the data.

3.1.11 Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition.,|3.1.11 Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition. Is the system configured to end a user session after a predetermined period based on duration and/or inactivity of session? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Are user sessions terminated automatically based upon company defined conditions? For example, 10 minute timeouts? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to other requirements that address the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses a company information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

Additional Information Remote access is access to a company’s IT system by a user communicating through an external network such as the internet. Remote access client devices generally have weaker protection than standard client devices. These may include:
• Many devices are not managed by the company and do not use enterprise firewalls or antivirus protection.
• A lack of physical security controls when using remote access.
• Remote access client devices may be used in hostile environments but not properly configured for them.
• Remote access communications are carried over untrusted networks. It is useful to note that one can “monitor and control remote access” by not providing the capability and employing procedural methods to ensure it has not been enabled.

No
Partially

Alternative Approach
Is cryptography used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information The NIST SP 800-171 requirements for cryptography used to protect the confidentiality of CUI must use Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) validated cryptography, which means the cryptographic module has been tested and validated to meet FIPS 140 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm (e.g., FIPS 197 for AES) is not sufficient – the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. When an application or device allows a choice (by selecting FIPS-mode or not), then the FIPS-mode has been validated under FIPS 140-2, but the other options (non-FIPS) allow certain operations that would not meet the FIPS requirements. More information is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/ When NIST SP 800-171 requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is required to protect CUI, typically when transmitted or stored outside the protected environment of the company’s information system (including wireless/remote access) if not separately protected (e.g., by a protected distribution system). FIPS-validated cryptography is required whenever the encryption is required to protect covered defense information in accordance with NIST SP 800-171 or by another DFARS contract provision. Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within the protected environment of the covered contractor information system, would not need to be FIPS-validated. Note that any separate contract requirement (not currently in NIST SP 800-171) to encrypt data at rest (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information - PII) within the information system would require use of FIPS-validated cryptography.

FIPS-validated cryptography is required whenever the encryption is required to protect covered defense information in accordance with NIST SP 800-171 or by another DFARS contract provision. Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within the protected environment of the covered contractor information system, would not need to be FIPS-validated. Note that any separate contract requirement (not currently in NIST SP 800-171) to encrypt data at rest (e.g., PII) within the information system would require use of FIPS-validated cryptography.

Additional Information External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by the company. Companies typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements or the assessment of their effectiveness in external information systems. External information systems include, for example: 1) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants); 2) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports); 3) information systems owned or controlled by nonfederal governmental organizations; and 4) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of companies.

Alternative Approach
Additional Information A ‘portable storage device’ is an information system component that can be inserted into and removed from an information system, and that is used to store data or information (e.g., text, video, audio, and/or image data). Such components are typically implemented on magnetic, optical, or solid-state devices (e.g., floppy disks, compact/digital video disks, flash/thumb drives, external hard disk drives, and flash memory cards/drives that contain non- volatile memory). Limits on the use of company-controlled portable storage devices in external information systems include, for example, complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used. This requirement is generally implemented by policy, though some devices can be configured to work only when connected to a system to which they can authenticate (this is, however, not a requirement).

Additional Information Improper use of the company’s proprietary information can damage the company. Improper use of CUI could cause damage to the government and/or its employees. This requirement addresses systems that are controlled by the company and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization information systems is covered by company policy. DOD uses a variety of markings to identify CUI, identified in DOD Manual 5200.01 Vol 4, which will be updated as the NARA CUI rule (32 CFR 2002) is implemented. The most common form of DOD CUI held by contractors is Controlled Technical Information, which is marked with Distribution Statements B-F. Other DOD information may be marked as ‘For Official Use Only’ – which may or may not be CUI, and the contracting officer should be consulted if this marking is encountered to determine if it is DOD CUI.Where to Look:

Alternative Approach
Additional Information Types of individual actions covered by non- repudiation include, for example, creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by: 
• authors of not having authored documents,
• senders of not having transmitted messages,
• receivers of not having received messages, or 
• signatories of not having signed documents.
Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Companies obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts).

Additional Information A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of company information systems. To apply the required security requirements within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions. Security engineering cannot be properly applied if individuals who design, code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do not understand security. It is important that developers include individuals on the development team who possess security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to the company’s business processes. This process also enables the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent with company risk management and information security strategies.

Additional Information Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware components and configuration settings. Companies ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups conducting tests understand company security policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with facilities/processes.
Operational systems may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems). Changes to information systems should be reviewed and approved by company management prior to implementation. Where to Look:
• configuration management policy

Additional Information Employees with information security responsibilities (e.g., Information System Administrators, Information System Security Officers, Information System Security Managers, and Information System Security Engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/ technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand requirement implementation and how specific changes might affect the requirements. Security impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security requirements are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in accordance with the security categories of the information systems. Where to Look:

Additional Information Any changes to the hardware, software, and/or firmware components of information systems can potentially have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Companies should permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access information systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Companies should maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).

Additional Information Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential company operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, companies should limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., VoIP, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). The deployment of information system components with reduced/minimal functionality reduces the need to secure every user endpoint, and may reduce the exposure of information, information systems, and services to cyber-attacks. It is good practice to block ports or protocols that are not needed in the operational environment. For example, if you do not need or use VoIP, don’t allow it. Where to Look:

Companies should consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/ protocols (e.g., Universal Serial Bus, File Transfer Protocol, and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Companies can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

Additional Information The requirements for allowing or disallowing the running of software may include (but not be limited to) the use of firewalls to restrict port access and user operational controls. The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on company information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting.
In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup.
The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on company information systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. Organizations can implement blacklisting instead of whitelisting (the stronger of the two policies) is the preferred approach for restricting software program execution. Policies can also be used to prevent certain types of software from being run on the company’s system (e.g., games).
Enforcement of these types of policies should be checked by periodic audit. This may provide a simpler approach to meeting this requirement for some companies. Where to Look:

Additional Information Approaches to meeting this requirement to control and monitor software installed by users can include policies and procedures. Policies should fully describe what is allowed and procedures should be in place to check that the policy is not violated.

Additional Information NIST SP 800-171 defines a “privileged user” as “a user that is authorized (and therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform.” For example, if users’ computer accounts are “administrator accounts” or have "limited administrative rights” only on their computers, are they considered a “privileged account” requiring multifactor authentication at the “local access level”? Since, in this case, the "ordinary users" are authorized to perform the function, they are not considered privileged users. Multifactor authentication (MFA) to an information system uses two or more methods of authentication involving something you know (e.g., password); something you have (e.g., a one-time password generating device like a fob, smart-card, or a mobile app on a smart-phone); and something you are (e.g., biometric like a fingerprint or iris). The traditional authentication method uses a single factor, typically a password, while multifactor authentication requires that a second factor also be used such as a PIN sent via a text message (using something you have – the cell phone) or something you are (fingerprint). Local Access means access to an organizational system by a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a direct connection without the use of a network. Network Access means access to a system by a user (or a process acting on behalf of a user) communicating through a network (e.g., local area network, wide area network, internet). 1. For a NON-PRIVILEGED user, using a standalone computer (e.g., a laptop computer), with no network access, the access can be via single factor authentication (SFA); MFA is not required. However, if used to connect to a LAN, the network access must be MFA. Typically, organizational desktops are used for network access and so the user must use MFA to access their network account.
 2. For a PRIVILEGED user, even local access requires MFA. MFA is not required to access a mobile device (e.g., smart phones) even if they contain covered defense information, as there is a separate requirement in NIST SP 800-171 (3.1.19) to encrypt CUI on mobile devices and mobile computing platforms, and typically mobile devices do not support MFA in order to access the device. However, if the mobile device is used to access a Covered Contractor Information System, then the system must provide the capability for MFA for access by the device, and which would be entered via the device (e.g., use of a one-time password (OTP) device and a password). An example: Access to the Army project data requires use of institutional multifactor authentication services. Multifactor authentication to an information system uses two or more methods of authentication involving something you know (e.g., password); something you have (e.g., a One-Time Password generating device like a fob, smart-card, or a mobile app on a smart- phone); and something you are (e.g., a biometric like a fingerprint or iris). New employees assigned to the Army project receive their account and instructions for creating a password from HR during the hiring process. New employees receive notification of their account via registered email with an activation link to set their initial password. Passwords may be reset by contacting the service desk and providing proof of identity, or using the online reset service using pre-defined challenge and response questions. Default passwords for information systems are changed before they are introduced to the network. Passwords are stored centrally in company managed authentication systems (and hashed using hashing algorithms). Encrypted transmission of passwords is required.

Additional Information A replay attack may enable an unauthorized user to gain access. Authentication sessions between the authenticator and the application validating the user credentials must not be vulnerable to a replay attack. An authentication process resists replay attacks (if it is impractical to achieve a successful authentication by recording and replaying a previous authentication message.) The authentication front-end technologies may include, for example, shibboleth, SSH, Microsoft remote desktop protocol, and SSL VPN. Backend authentication mechanisms in use may include, for example, Kerberos and Active Directory. Per NIST SP 800-53, Security Controls and Assessment Procedures for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, upon which NIST SP 800-171 is based (and references if additional information is required), “authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to achieve successful authentications by replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques include, for example, protocols that use nonces or challenges such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and time synchronous or challenge-response one-time authenticators.” A nonce is a randomly generated value used to defeat “playback” attacks in communication protocols. One party randomly generates a nonce and sends it to the other party. The receiver encrypts it using the agreed upon secret key and returns it to the sender. Because the sender randomly generated the nonce, this defeats playback attacks because the replayer cannot know in advance the nonce the sender will generate. The receiver denies connections that do not have the correctly encrypted nonce.

Additional Information Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC), internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is not applicable to shared information system accounts (e.g., guest and anonymous accounts). Typically, individual identifiers are the user names of the information system accounts assigned to those individuals. In such instances, the account management activities use account names provided. This requirement also addresses individual identifiers not necessarily associated with information system accounts (e.g., identifiers used in physical security control databases accessed by badge reader systems for access to information systems. Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices. Where to Look:

Alternative Approach
Additional information: “Password hashing” performs a one-way transformation on a password, turning the password into another string, called the hashed password. “One-way” means that it is practically impossible to go the other way, i.e., to turn the hashed password back into the original password. In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that "hashes” a password or passphrase. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks or against a pre-computed rainbow table attack. A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a plaintext password up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically a password was stored in plaintext on a system, but over time, additional safeguards developed to protect a user’s password against being read from the system. A new salt is randomly generated for each password and never re-used. Where to Look:

3.5.11 Obscure feedback of authentication information.,|3.5.11 Obscure feedback of authentication information. Do the authentication mechanisms obscure feedback of authentication information during the authentication process? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Do the authentication mechanisms not return any system specific information such as “wrong password” or “wrong username”? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
 Additional Information This requirement seeks to prevent an observer from viewing authentication information, such as a password, while it is being entered. One technique to obscure feedback is to have dots appear in the password window while it is being typed instead of the actual characters being entered. The most basic feedback control is never informing the user in an error message what part of the of the authentication transaction failed. In the case of shibboleth, for example, the error message is generic regardless of whether the userid was mistyped, the password was wrong, or (in the case of MFA) there was a problem with the MFA credential provided — the failure simply says that the credentials were invalid. Likewise, unsuccessful authentications at the Kerberos KDCs don’t distinguish between the “principal not found” and the “invalid key” case. LDAP-based authentication interfaces only return a “failure to bind” message from both the main LDAPs and the AD. Where to Look:

Alternative Approach
Additional Information Non-local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. The multifactor authentication for non-local maintenance is intended for recurring non-local maintenance by organizational personnel rather than episodic non-local maintenance by outside vendors where issuance of such credentials for one-time activities is not efficient and may not be advisable. Presuming the individual performing the repair is known and trusted, it is possible to provide for “one-time” multifactor authentication using a password and a separately provided token (e.g., PIN via text message to a cell phone).

Additional Information Physically controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas for which companies provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information system. For media containing information determined by companies to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on the company or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed.

Alternative Approach
Additional Information This requirement applies to all information system media, both digital and nondigital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether or not the media is considered removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Companies should determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Companies may use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. NIST SP 800-88 “Guidelines for Media Sanitization” provides useful information that will assist companies in implementing a media sanitization program with proper and applicable techniques and controls for sanitization and disposal decisions, available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf.

No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Are removable system media and system output marked? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable security attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use of security attributes regarding internal data structures within information systems. Security marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by companies to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, some companies may require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. This security requirement is meant to be applied by using physical controls to access physical media, but other mechanisms for logical access are acceptable. It applies to information system media, which includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/ removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. It does not include cell or smartphones. The requirements of the DFARS clause only apply to covered defense information, i.e., information provided or developed by the contractor for DOD which is Controlled Technical Information or other information requiring protection by law, regulation, or government-wide policy. It does not apply to information provided by or developed for non- DOD organizations. Guidance on marking media, along with other materials, should be addressed separately in the contract and is derived from DOD Manual 5200.01, Volume 4, “DOD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

Alternative Approach
Additional Information This requirement also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for example, locked rooms, containers, and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel, and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Companies should establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with company assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related records.

Alternative Approach Additional Information This requirement also applies to mobile computing and communications devices with information storage capability (e.g., notebooks/ laptop computers, personal digital assistants, cell/smart phones, digital cameras and audio recording devices) that are transported outside of controlled areas. Telephone systems are also considered information systems and may have the capability to store information on internal media (e.g., on voicemail). Key vaults help safeguard cryptographic keys and secrets systems, applications, and services. By using a key vault, you can encrypt keys and secrets (such as authentication keys, storage account keys, data encryption keys, and passwords) by using keys that are protected by hardware security modules (HSMs). For added assurance, you can import or generate keys in HSMs. Key vaults streamline the key management process and enables you to maintain control of keys that access and encrypt your data.

Additional Information Risk assessments play a critical role in the development and implementation of effective information security programs and help companies address a range of security-related issues from advanced persistent threats to supply chain concerns. The results of risk assessments are used to develop specific courses of action that can provide effective response measures to the identified risks as part of a broad-based risk management process.
There is no defined requirement, methodology, or period for the assessments, nor is a report required. These are dependent on the organization, its mission, changes to its systems and environment. This is a periodic assessment of how you operate to insure you understand your risk, which can change over time. Any changes resulting from the assessment would be reflected in implementing plans of action and in the system security plan per NIST SP 800-171 requirements 3.12.2 and 3.12.4.

Alternative Approach
Additional Information Vulnerability scanning identifies hosts and host attributes (e.g., operating systems, applications, open ports), but it also attempts to identify vulnerabilities rather than relying on human interpretation of the scanning results. Many vulnerability scanners are equipped to accept results from network discovery and network port and service identification, which reduces the amount of work needed for vulnerability scanning. Also, some scanners can perform their own network discovery and network port and service identification. Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization’s security policy. This is done by identifying the operating systems and major software applications running on the hosts and matching them with information on known vulnerabilities stored in the scanners’ vulnerability databases. Vulnerability scanners can: check compliance with host application usage and security policies; provide information on targets for penetration testing; and provide information on how to mitigate discovered vulnerabilities.

Additional Information To satisfy periodic (e.g., annual) assessment requirements, companies can use assessment results from the initial or ongoing information system authorizations, continuous monitoring, or system development life cycle activities.
Companies should ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security requirement effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security requirement assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. Companies should establish the frequency for ongoing security requirement assessments in accordance with company continuous monitoring strategies. Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedure. Assessments should be performed at least annually. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this requirement. The company should define for itself when requirements are assessed, which may be based on a timeframe determined by its needs and/or events, such as a change to the system or its environment.

Alternative Approach
Additional Information Companies can maximize the value of assessments of security requirements during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. There is no defined period for security requirement assessments. The company should define for itself when requirements are assessed, which may be based on a timeframe determined by its needs and/ or events, such as a change to the system or its environment. There is no prescribed format or level of specificity for a system security plan (see 3.12.4 System Security Plan), and DOD Contracting Officers/Requiring Activities should not prescribe a format or level of specificity. Per Chapter 3 of NIST SP 800-171, rev 1, “Organizations can document the system security plan and plan of action as separate or combined documents and in any chosen format.” The complete system security plan can be quite sensitive and typically DOD does not need the description of system boundaries and operational environment (or other sensitive information that the company may have included in the system security plan to make it operationally useful for their purposes) to demonstrate the organization’s implementation or planned implementation of the NIST SP 800-171 security requirements.
Accordingly, the requiring activity/contracting officer should not require in the solicitation that the actual system security plan be submitted, but rather an extract that describes how the individual security requirements are implemented, and any associated plans of action to implement security requirements not yet met. A company should tailor its submission, or extract of the system security plan, to provide only the information required by the solicitation, and avoid including sensitive information that is not required. The requiring activity may specify in the solicitation, however, that the contractor must provide information in the technical proposal in a particular format and level of detail. This should NOT be interpreted as prescribing a particular format or level of detail for a contractor’s system security plan or plans of action. Also in accordance with Chapter 3 of NIST SP 800-171, rev 1, “federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as critical inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a system hosted by a nonfederal organization.” As such, they may determine that the risk is such that they will not pursue an agreement or contract with the organization.

Additional Information There is no prescribed format or specified level of detail for system security plans. However, companies must ensure that the required information in 3.12.4 is appropriately conveyed in those plans. Some systems, including specialized systems (e.g., industrial/process control systems, Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines), may have restrictions or limitations on the application of certain security requirements. To accommodate such issues, the system security plan should be used to describe any enduring exceptions to the security requirements. Individual, isolated, or temporary deficiencies should be managed though plans of action. System security plans describe how the company meets the security requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation. System security plans contain sufficient information to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to company operations and assets, employees, and other organizations, if the plan is implemented as intended.
System security plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents including documents that already exist within the company. Effective systems security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures,

Additional Information Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical. Companies implement separation of system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources.

Partially

Alternative Approach
Are all alternative physical safeguards used to provide confidentiality of CUI during transmission documented? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information Encrypting information for transmission protects information from unauthorized disclosure and modification. Cryptographic mechanisms implemented to protect information integrity include, for example, cryptographic hash functions which have common application in digital signatures, checksums, and message authentication codes. Alternative physical security safeguards include, for example, protected distribution systems. The NIST SP 800-171 requirements for cryptography used to protect the confidentiality of CUI must use FIPS-validated cryptography, which means the cryptographic module must have been tested and validated to meet FIPS 140-1 or -2 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm (e.g., FIPS 197 for AES) is not sufficient. The module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. When an application or device allows a choice (by selecting FIPS-mode or not), then the FIPS-mode has been validated under FIPS 140-2, but the other options (non-FIPS) allow certain operations that would not meet the FIPS requirements. More information is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/ When NIST SP 800-171 requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is required to protect CUI, typically when transmitted or stored outside the protected environment of the covered contractor information system (including wireless/remote access) if not separately protected (e.g., by a protected distribution system). FIPS-validated cryptography is required whenever the encryption is required to protect covered defense information in accordance with NIST SP 800-171 or by another DFARS contract provision. Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within the protected environment of the covered contractor information system, would not need to be FIPS-validated.
Note that any separate contract requirement (not currently in NIST SP 800-171) to encrypt data at rest (e.g., PII) within the information system would require use of FIPS validated cryptography. Encryption, though preferred, is not required if using common-carrier provided Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) private network, as the MPLS separation provides sufficient protection without encryption. Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol can be used to protect CUI during transmission over the internet. The current version of TLS (TLS 1.2) is preferred. If earlier versions must be used to interact with certain organizations, the servers shall not support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 3.0 or earlier. The cryptographic module used by the server and client must be a FIPS 140-validated cryptographic module. All cryptographic algorithms that are included in the configured cipher suites must be within the scope of the validation, as well as the random number generator. For further information see NIST SP 800-52, rev 1, “Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations.” http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r1. pdf Where to Look:

Alternative Approach
Do communication cryptographic mechanisms comply with applicable policies, standards, and guidance? Yes
No
Partially

Alternative Approach
Additional Information Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions including the protection of CUI, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS- validated cryptography. The NIST SP 800-171 requirements for cryptography used to protect the confidentiality of CUI must use FIPS-validated cryptography, which means the cryptographic module must have been tested and validated to meet FIPS 140-1 or -2 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm (e.g., FIPS 197 for AES) is not sufficient. The module (software and/ or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. When an application or device allows a choice (by selecting FIPS-mode or not), then the FIPS-mode has been validated under FIPS 140-2, but the other options (non- FIPS) allow certain operations that would not meet the FIPS requirements. More information is available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/ When NIST SP 800-171 requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is required to protect CUI, typically when transmitted or stored outside the protected environment of the covered contractor information system (including wireless/remote access) if not separately protected (e.g., by a protected distribution system). FIPS-validated cryptography is required whenever the encryption is required to protect covered defense information in accordance with NIST SP 800-171 or by another DFARS contract provision.

3.13.14 Control and monitor the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies.,|3.13.14 Control and monitor the use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies. Is the use of VoIP controlled? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
 Is the use of VoIP authorized, and monitored? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a type of hardware and software that enables people to use the internet as the transmission pathway for telephone calls. VoIP sends voice data in packets by means of internet protocols (IP) instead of using traditional circuit transmissions of the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Both the voice and data worlds come with the inherent IP security risks, when using the traditional voice side of the network through the application of VoIP. VoIP use necessitates security measures such as encrypting voice services, building redundancy into VoIP networks, locking down VoIP servers, and performing regular security audits on the network. It is also important that VoIP equipment is properly secured, it should be placed behind firewalls, and patched against vulnerabilities. VoIP should be monitored frequently using intrusion- detection systems. If VoIP is physically or cryptographically isolated from the information systems processing CUI, this security requirement would not apply. However it is still prudent to control who uses VoIP since CUI could be taken from the information system and communicated via a VoIP system. Policies and procedures are needed to ensure CUI remains within the system that stores and processes it. See 3.1.2, 3.1.3, and 3.1.4 in the Access Control Family. Where to Look:
• system and communications protection policy
• procedures addressing VoIP

Alternative Approach
Does the system protect the confidentiality of information at rest? Yes
No
Partially
Does Not Apply
Alternative Approach
Additional Information This requirement addresses the confidentiality of information at rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information requiring protection includes configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Companies may also employ other security requirements including secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest. CUI can be stored at rest in any non-mobile devices or data center, unencrypted, as long as it is protected by other approved logical or physical methods. The mapped NIST SP 800-53, “Security Controls and Assessment Procedures for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,” control (SC-8), notes that this requirement is to protect the confidentiality of CUI information at rest when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems and that “organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality protection, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning.” Thus, encryption is an option, not a requirement. Where to Look:

Alternative Approach
Additional Information Companies identify information systems affected by announced software flaws including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to employees with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti- virus signatures. Organizations also address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in company information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management processes, required/ anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations follow US-CERT guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Companies determine the degree and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, companies may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates is not necessary or practical, for example, when implementing simple anti-virus signature updates. Companies may also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures. Where to Look:

Additional Information Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by different means including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and reputation- based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect company business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, companies should rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than those intended. Companies may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, companies can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/ or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

Additional Information Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information system.
Companies can monitor information systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on company monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies.
Information system monitoring is an integral part of company continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.
