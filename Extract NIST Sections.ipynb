External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information system.\n",
      "Companies can monitor information systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on company monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies.\n",
