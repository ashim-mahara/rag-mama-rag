AC.L1-3.1.1 – Authorized Access Control,Access Control (AC),Level 1 AC Practices,|Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of 
authorized users, or devices (including other information systems). 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] authorized users are identified; 
[b] processes acting on behalf of authorized users are identified; 
[c] devices (and other systems) authorized to connect to the system are identified; 
[d] system access is limited to authorized users; 
[e] system access is limited to processes acting on behalf of authorized users; and 
[f] system access is limited to authorized devices (including other systems). 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing account management; system 
security plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated 
documentation; list of active system accounts and the name of the individual associated with 
each account; notifications or records of recently transferred, separated, or terminated 
employees; list of conditions for group and role membership; list of recently disabled system 
accounts along with the name of the individual associated with each account; access 
authorization records; account management compliance reviews; system monitoring 
records; system audit logs and records; list of devices and systems authorized to connect to 
organizational systems; other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with account management responsibilities; system or network 
administrators; personnel with information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing system accounts; mechanisms for 
implementing account management]. DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and 
cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes 
acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and 
domains) in systems. Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application 
and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include systems 
internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management 
for systems and applications. The definition of and enforcement of access authorizations, 
other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses [sic] non-privileged) are 
addressed in requirement 3.1.2 (AC.L1-3.1.2). 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can 
log on to the company network. Automated updates and other automatic processes should 
be associated with the user who initiated (authorized) the process. Limit the devices (e.g., 
printers) that can be accessed by company computers. Set up your system so that only 
authorized users, processes, and devices can access the company network. 
This practice, AC.L1-3.1.1, controls system access based on user, process, or device 
identity. AC.L1-3.1.1 leverages IA.L1-3.5.1 which provides a vetted and trusted identity for 
access control. 
Example 1 
Your company maintains a list of all personnel authorized to use company information 
systems [a]. This list is used to support identification and authentication activities conducted 
by IT when authorizing access to systems [a,d]. 
Example 2 
A coworker wants to buy a new multi-function printer/scanner/fax device and make it 
available on the company network. You explain that the company controls system and device 
access to the network and will prevent network access by unauthorized systems and devices 
[c]. You help the coworker submit a ticket that asks for the printer to be granted access to 
the network, and appropriate leadership approves the device [f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is a list of authorized users maintained that defines their identities and roles [a]? 
 Are account requests authorized before system access is granted [d,e,f]?3

AC.L1-3.1.2 – Transaction & Function Control,AC.L1-3.1.2 – TRANSACTION & FUNCTION CONTROL,Level 1 AC Practices,|Limit information system access to the types of transactions and functions that authorized 
users are permitted to execute. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] the types of transactions and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute 
are defined; and 
[b] system access is limited to the defined types of transactions and functions for 
authorized users. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing access enforcement; system 
security plan; system design documentation; list of approved authorizations including 
remote access authorizations; system audit logs and records; system configuration settings 
and associated documentation; other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with access enforcement responsibilities; system or network 
administrators; personnel with information security responsibilities; system developers]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type 
of account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group, 
system, anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary. 
Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-
week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider 
system-related requirements (e.g., system upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission 
or business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote 
access to support travel requirements). 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Limit users to only the information systems, roles, or applications they are permitted to use 
and are needed for their roles and responsibilities. Limit access to applications and data based on the authorized users’ roles and responsibilities. Common types of functions a user 
can be assigned are create, read, update, and delete. 
Example 
You supervise the team that manages DoD contracts for your company. Members of your 
team need to access the contract information to perform their work properly. Because some 
of that data contains FCI, you work with IT to set up your group’s systems so that users can 
be assigned access based on their specific roles [a]. Each role limits whether an employee 
has read-access or create/read/delete/update -access [b]. Implementing this access control 
restricts access to FCI information unless specifically authorized. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are access control lists used to limit access to applications and data based on role and/or 
identity [a]?4 
 Is access for authorized users restricted to those parts of the system they are explicitly 
permitted to use (e.g., a person who only performs word-processing cannot access 
developer tools) [b]?5

AC.L1-3.1.20 – External Connections,AC.L1-3.1.20 – EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS,Level 1 AC Practices,|Verify and control/limit connections to and use of external information systems. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] connections to external systems are identified; 
[b] the use of external systems is identified; 
[c] connections to external systems are verified; 
[d] the use of external systems is verified; 
[e] connections to external systems are controlled/limited; and 
[f] the use of external systems is controlled/limited. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of external systems; 
terms and conditions for external systems; system security plan; list of applications 
accessible from external systems; system configuration settings and associated 
documentation; system connection or processing agreements; account management

external systems to access organizational systems; system or network administrators; 
personnel with information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing terms and conditions on use of external 
systems]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically 
have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and 
controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems. 
External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-
owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities. 
This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or 
transmission of FCI, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, 
platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems. Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance 
with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a 
minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from 
external systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be 
established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those 
external systems. 
This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external 
systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those 
situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary 
controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems. 
Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved 
by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the 
assurance or confidence level required by organizations. 
Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization’s direct supervision 
and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of FCI across an 
organization, the organization may have systems that process FCI and others that do not. 
And among the systems that process FCI there are likely access restrictions for FCI that apply 
between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within 
the organization may be considered “external" to that system. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks. 
Outside networks could include the public internet, one of your own company’s networks 
that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that 
does not belong to your company. Tools to accomplish include firewalls and connection 
allow/deny lists. External systems not controlled by your company could be running 
applications that are prohibited or blocked. Control and limit access to corporate networks 
from personally owned devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones. You may choose to limit 
how and when your network is connected to outside systems or only allow certain 
employees to connect to outside systems from network resources. 
Example 
You and your coworkers are working on a big proposal and will put in extra hours over the 
weekend to get it done. Part of the proposal includes FCI. Because FCI should not be shared 
publicly, you remind your coworkers of the policy requirement to use their company laptops, 
not personal laptops or tablets, when working on the proposal over the weekend [b,f]. You 
also remind everyone to work from the cloud environment that is approved for processing 
and storing FCI rather than the other collaborative tools that may be used for other projects 
[b,f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are all connections to external systems outside of the assessment scope identified [a]?  
 Are external systems (e.g., systems managed by contractors, partners, or vendors; 
personal devices) that are permitted to connect to or make use of organizational systems 
identified [b]? 
 Are methods employed to ensure that only authorized connections are being made to 
external systems (e.g., requiring log-ins or certificates, access from a specific IP address, 
or access via Virtual Private Network (VPN)) [c,e]? 
 Are methods employed to confirm that only authorized external systems are connecting 
(e.g., if employees are receiving company email on personal cell phones, is the contractor 
checking to verify that only known/expected devices are connecting) [d]?  
 Is the use of external systems limited, including by policy or physical control [f]?

AC.L1-3.1.22 – Control Public Information,AC.L1-3.1.22 – CONTROL PUBLIC INFORMATION,Level 1 AC Practices,|Control information posted or processed on publicly accessible information systems. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] individuals authorized to post or process information on publicly accessible systems 
are identified; 
[b] procedures to ensure FCI is not posted or processed on publicly accessible systems are 
identified; 
[c] a review process is in place prior to posting of any content to publicly accessible

[d] content on publicly accessible systems is reviewed to ensure that it does not include 
FCI; and 
[e] mechanisms are in place to remove and address improper posting of FCI. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing publicly accessible content; 
system security plan; list of users authorized to post publicly accessible content on 
organizational systems; training materials and/or records; records of publicly accessible 
information reviews; records of response to nonpublic information on public websites;

documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with responsibilities for managing publicly accessible 
information posted on organizational systems; personnel with information security 
responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing management of publicly accessible content]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
In accordance with laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, or standards, the 
public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under 
the Privacy Act, FCI, and proprietary information). This requirement addresses systems that 
are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without 
identification or authentication. Individuals authorized to post FCI onto publicly accessible systems are designated. The content of information is reviewed prior to posting onto 
publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Do not allow FCI to become public – always safeguard the confidentiality of FCI by controlling 
the posting of FCI on company-controlled websites or public forums, and the exposure of FCI 
in public presentations or on public displays. It is important to know which users are allowed 
to publish information on publicly accessible systems, like your company website, and 
implement a review process before posting such information. If FCI is discovered on a 
publicly accessible system, procedures should be in place to remove that information and 
alert the appropriate parties. 
Example 
Your company decides to start issuing press releases about its projects in an effort to reach 
more potential customers. Your company receives FCI from the government as part of its 
DoD contract. Because you recognize the need to manage controlled information, including 
FCI, you meet with the employees who write the releases and post information to establish 
a review process [c]. It is decided that you will review press releases for FCI before posting 
it on the company website [a,d]. Only certain employees will be authorized to post to the 
website [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Does information on externally facing systems (i.e., publicly accessible) have a 
documented approval chain for public release [c]?

Determine if: 
[a] information flow control policies are defined; 
[b] methods and enforcement mechanisms for controlling the flow of CUI are defined; 
[c] designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) for CUI

[e] approved authorizations for controlling the flow of CUI are enforced. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; information flow control policies; procedures 
addressing information flow enforcement; system security plan; system design 
documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of 
information flow authorizations; system baseline configuration; system audit logs and 
records; other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security 
responsibilities; system developers]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Information flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and 
between systems (versus who can access the information) and without explicit regard to 
subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include the following: 
keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the internet; 
blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization; restricting requests 
to the internet that are not from the internal web proxy server; and limiting information 
transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Organizations commonly use information flow control policies and enforcement 
mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations 
(e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within systems and between interconnected 
systems. Flow control is based on characteristics of the information or the information path. 
Enforcement occurs in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, 
encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that 
restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, 
or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word 
searches or using document characteristics). Organizations 
also consider the 
trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and 
software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. 
Transferring information between systems representing different security domains with 
different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain 
security policies. 
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the 
implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. 
Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and 
consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may 
also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission 
services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. NIST 
SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. SP 800-125B provides 
guidance on security for virtualization technologies. 
In such situations, information owners or stewards provide guidance at designated policy 
enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating 
specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. 
Enforcement includes: prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems 
(i.e., allowing access only); employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way 
information flows; and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign 
security attributes and security labels. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Typically, companies will have a firewall between the internal network and the internet. 
Often multiple firewalls or routing switches are used inside a network to create zones to 
separate sensitive data, business units, or user groups. Proxy servers can be used to break 
the connection between multiple networks. All traffic entering or leaving a network is 
intercepted by the proxy, preventing direct access between networks. Companies should 
also ensure by policy and enforcement mechanisms that all CUI allowed to flow across the 
internet is encrypted. 
Example 1 
As a system administrator, you configure a proxy device on your company’s network. Your 
goal is to better mask and protect the devices inside the network while enforcing information 
flow policies. After the device is configured, information does not flow directly from the 
internal network to the internet. The proxy device intercepts the traffic and analyzes it to 
determine if the traffic conforms to organization information flow control policies. If it does, 
the device allows the information to pass to its destination [b]. The proxy blocks traffic that 
does not meet policy requirements [e]. 
Example 2 
As a subcontractor on a DoD contract, your organization sometimes needs to transmit CUI to 
the prime contractor. You create a policy document that specifies who is allowed to transmit 
CUI and that such transmission requires manager approval [a,c,d]. The policy instructs users 
to encrypt any CUI transmitted via email or to use a designated secure file sharing utility 
[b,d]. The policy states that users who do not follow appropriate procedures may be subject 
to disciplinary action [e]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are designated sources of regulated data identified within the system (e.g., internal 
network and IP address) and between interconnected systems (e.g., external networks, 
IP addresses, ports, and protocols) [c]? 
 Are designated destinations of regulated data identified within the system (e.g., internal 
network and IP address) and between interconnected systems (external networks and 
IP addresses) [c]? 
 Are authorizations defined for each source and destination within the system and 
between interconnected systems (e.g., allow or deny rules for each combination of source 
and destination) [d]? 
 Are approved authorizations for controlling the flow of regulated data enforced within 
the system and between interconnected systems (e.g., traffic between authorized sources 
and destinations is allowed and traffic between unauthorized sources and destinations 
is denied) [e]?

[a] the duties of individuals requiring separation are defined; 
[b] responsibilities for duties that require separation are assigned to separate individuals; 
and 
[c] access privileges that enable individuals to exercise the duties that require separation

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing separation of duties policy]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to 
reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes 
dividing mission functions and system support functions among different individuals or 
roles; conducting system support functions with different individuals (e.g., configuration 
management, quality assurance and testing, system management, programming, and 
network security); and ensuring that security personnel administering access control 
functions do not also administer audit functions. Because separation of duty violations can 
span systems and application domains, organizations consider the entirety of organizational 
systems and system components when developing policy on separation of duties. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
No one person should be in charge of an entire critical task from beginning to end. 
Documenting and dividing elements of important duties and tasks between employees 
reduces intentional or unintentional execution of malicious activities. 
Example 1 
You are responsible for the management of several key systems within your organization. 
You assign the task of reviewing the system logs to two different people. This way, no one 
person is solely responsible for the execution of this critical security function [c]. 
Example 2 
You are a system administrator. Human Resources notifies you of a new hire, and you create 
an account with general privileges, but you are not allowed to grant access to systems that 
contain CUI [a,b]. The program manager contacts the team in your organization that has 
system administration authority over the CUI systems and informs them which CUI the new 
hire will need to access. Subsequently, a second system administrator grants access 
privileges to the new hire [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Does system documentation identify the system functions or processes that require 
separation of duties (e.g., function combinations that represent a conflict of interest or 
an over-allocation of security privilege for one individual) [a]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing system accounts; mechanisms for 
implementing account management; mechanisms implementing least privilege functions; 
mechanisms prohibiting privileged access to the system]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations employ the principle of least privilege for specific duties and authorized 
accesses for users and processes. The principle of least privilege is applied with the goal of 
authorized privileges no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions or business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, 
roles, and system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply 
least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational systems. 
Security functions include establishing system accounts, setting events to be logged, setting 
intrusion detection parameters, and configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, 
privileges). 
Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system 
administrator for various types of commercial off-the-shelf operating systems. Restricting 
privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having 
access to privileged information or functions. Organizations may differentiate in the 
application of this requirement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain 
accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control system configurations for key 
security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The principle of least privilege applies to all users and processes on all systems, but it is 
critical to systems containing or accessing CUI. Least privilege: 
 restricts user access to only the machines and information needed to fulfill job 
responsibilities; and 
 limits what system configuration settings users can change, only allowing individuals 
with a business need to change them. 
Example 
As a system administrator, you create accounts. By default, everyone is assigned a basic user 
role, which prevents a user from modifying system configurations. Privileged access is only 
assigned to users and processes that require it to carry out job functions, such as IT staff, and 
is very selectively granted [b,d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are privileged accounts documented and is when they may be used defined [a]? 
 Are users assigned privileged accounts to perform their job functions only when it is 
necessary [b]? 
 Are necessary security functions identified (e.g., access control configuration, system 
configuration settings, or privileged account lists) that must be managed through the use 
of privileged accounts [c]? 
 Is access to privileged functions and security information restricted to authorized 
employees [d]?6

responsibilities; system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing least privilege functions]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. 
The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control 
policies such as role-based access control and where a change of role provides the same 
degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for the user and all processes 
acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-
privileged account. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A user with a privileged account can perform more tasks and access more information than 
a person with a non-privileged account. Tasks (including unauthorized tasks orchestrated 
by attackers) performed when using the privileged account can have a greater impact on the 
system. System administrators and users with privileged accounts must be trained not to use 
their privileged accounts for everyday tasks, such as browsing the internet or connecting 
unnecessarily to other systems or services. Example 
You are a system administrator logged in using your privileged account and you need to look 
up how to reset a non-functioning application. You should log on to another computer with 
your non-privileged account before you connect to the web and start searching for the reset 
information [b]. That way, if your account is compromised during the search, it will be your 
regular user account rather than an account with elevated privileges. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are nonsecurity functions and non-privileged roles defined [a,b]? 
 Is it required that nonsecurity functions only be accessed with the use of non-privileged 
accounts? How is this verified [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Privileged functions include establishing system accounts, performing system integrity 
checks, conducting patching operations, or administering cryptographic key management 
activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate 
authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious 
code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection 
from non-privileged users. Note that this requirement represents a condition to be achieved 
by the definition of authorized privileges in 3.1.2 (AC.L1-3.1.2). Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, 
or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised system accounts, is a serious 
and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Logging the 
use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate 
the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Non-privileged users should receive only those permissions required to perform their basic 
job functions. Privileged users are granted additional permissions because their jobs require 
them. Privileged functions typically involve the control, monitoring, or administration of the 
system and its security measures. When these special privileged functions are performed, 
the activity must be captured in an audit log, which can be used to identify abuse. Non-
privileged employees must not be granted permission to perform any of the functions of a 
privileged user. 
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.7, manages non-privileged users by logging any attempts to execute 
privileged functions. AC.L2-3.1.7 leverages AU.L2-3.3.2, which ensures logging and 
traceability of user actions. AC.L2-3.1.7 also extends AC.L1-3.1.2, which defines a 
requirement to limit types of transactions and functions to those that authorized users are 
permitted to execute. 
Example 
As a system administrator for your organization, you have put security controls in place that 
prevent non-privileged users from performing privileged activities [a,b,c]. However, you 
accidentally gave a standard user elevated system administrator privileges. The organization 
has implemented an endpoint detection and response solution that provides visibility into 
the use of privileged activities. The monitoring system logs a security misconfiguration 
because the use of administrative privileges was performed by a user who was not known to 
have that ability. This allows you to correct the error [d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is it possible to identify who enabled privileges at any particular time [d]? 
 Are the privileged system functions documented (e.g., functions that involve the control, 
monitoring or administration of the system, including security functions and log 
management) [a]? 
 Do documented procedures describe the configuration of the system to ensure system 
roles do not grant non-privileged users the ability to execute privileged functions [c]? 
 Do procedures describe the configuration of system settings to capture the execution of 
all privileged functions in audit logs [d]?

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] the means of limiting unsuccessful logon attempts is defined; and 
[b] the defined means of limiting unsuccessful logon attempts is implemented. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A]

[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing unsuccessful logon attempts; 
system security plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and

system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy for unsuccessful logon 
attempts]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies regardless of whether the logon occurs via a local or network 
connection. Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems 
are, in most cases, temporary and automatically release after a predetermined period 
established by the organization (i.e., a delay algorithm). If a delay algorithm is selected, 
organizations may employ different algorithms for different system components based on 
the capabilities of the respective components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts 
may be implemented at the operating system and application levels. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts may indicate malicious activity. Contractors can 
mitigate these attacks by limiting the number of unsuccessful logon attempts, typically by 
locking the account. A defined number of consecutive unsuccessful logon attempts is a 
common configuration setting. Contractors are expected to set this number at a level that fits 
their risk profile with the knowledge that fewer unsuccessful attempts provide higher 
security. After an unsuccessful login attempt threshold is exceeded and the system locks an account, 
the account may either remain locked until an administrator takes action to unlock it, or it 
may be locked for a predefined time after which it unlocks automatically. 
Example 
You attempt to log on to your work computer. You mistype your password three times in a 
row, and an error message is generated telling you the account is locked [b]. You call your IT 
help desk or system administrator to request assistance. The system administrator explains 
that the account is locked as a result of three unsuccessful logon attempts [a]. The 
administrator offers to unlock the account and notes that you can wait 30 minutes for the 
account to unlock automatically. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is there a defined threshold for the number of unsuccessful logon attempts for which the 
system takes action to prevent additional attempts [a]? 
 Is a mechanism for limiting the number of unsuccessful logon attempts implemented and 
does it use the defined threshold [b]?

[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system use notification]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed 
before individuals log in to organizational systems. System use notifications are used only 
for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human 
interfaces do not exist. Based on a risk assessment, organizations consider whether a 
secondary system use notification is needed to access applications or other system resources 
after the initial network logon. Where necessary, posters or other printed materials may be 
used in lieu of an automated system banner. Organizations consult with the Office of General 
Counsel for legal review and approval of warning banner content. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Every system containing or providing access to CUI has legal requirements concerning user 
privacy and security notices. One method of addressing this requirement is the use of a system-use notification banner that displays the legal requirements of using the system. 
Users may be required to click to agree to the displayed requirements of using the system 
each time they log on to the machine. This agreement can be used in the civil and/or criminal 
prosecution of an attacker that violates the terms. 
The legal notification should meet all applicable requirements. At a minimum, the notice 
should inform the user that: 
 information system usage may be monitored or recorded, and is subject to audit; 
 unauthorized use of the information systems is prohibited; 
 unauthorized use is subject to criminal and civil penalties;  
 use of the information system affirms consent to monitoring and recording; 
 the information system contains CUI with specific requirements imposed by the 
Department of Defense; and 
 use of the information system may be subject to other specified requirements associated 
with certain types of CUI such as Export Controlled information. 
Example 
You are setting up IT equipment including a database server that will contain CUI. You have 
worked with legal counsel to draft a notification. It contains both general and specific CUI 
security and privacy requirements [a]. The system displays the required security and privacy 
information before anyone logs on to your organization’s computers that contain or provide 
access to CUI [b].  
For more information on CUI, refer to https://www.dodcui.mil/. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are requirements identified for privacy and security notices, and do the implemented 
practices match those identified requirements [a,b]? Discrepancies may indicate a 
deficient process and/or an incomplete practice.  
 Are there any special requirements associated with the specific CUI category [a]? 
 Are appropriate notices displayed in areas where paper-based CUI is stored and 
processed [b]?

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]

[a] the period of inactivity after which the system initiates a session lock is defined; 
[b] access to the system and viewing of data is prevented by initiating a session lock after

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing access control policy for session lock]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the 
immediate vicinity of the system but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature 
of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined, 
typically at the operating system level (but can also be at the application level). Session locks 
are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of the system, for example, if organizations 
require users to log out at the end of the workday. 
Pattern-hiding displays can include static or dynamic images, for example, patterns used 
with screen savers, photographic images, solid colors, clock, battery life indicator, or a blank 
screen, with the additional caveat that none of the images convey controlled unclassified 
information. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Session locks can be initiated by the user or, more fundamentally, enabled automatically 
when the system has been idle for a period of time, for example, five minutes. Session locks 
are a quick way to prevent unauthorized use of the systems without having a user log off. 
Minimum configuration requirements are left up to the organization to define.  
A locked session shows pattern-hiding information on the screen to mask the data on the 
display. 
Example 
You are a system administrator. You notice that employees leave their offices without locking 
their computers. Sometimes their screens display sensitive company information. You 
configure all machines to lock after five minutes of inactivity [a,b]. You also remind your 
coworkers to lock their systems when they walk away [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Does the session lock hide previously visible information (e.g., replacing what was visible 
with a lock screen or screensaver that does not include sensitive information) [c]? 
 If session locks are not managed centrally, how are all computer users made aware of the 
requirements and how to configure them [a,b,c]?

AC.L2-3.1.11 – Session Termination,AC.L2-3.1.11 – SESSION TERMINATION,Level 2 AC Practices,|Terminate (automatically) a user session after a defined condition. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] conditions requiring a user session to terminate are defined; and 
[b] a user session is automatically terminated after any of the defined conditions occur. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing session termination; system 
design documentation; system security plan; system configuration settings and associated

Interview 
[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security 
responsibilities; system developers]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing user session termination]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to 
the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions 
(i.e., disconnecting from the network). A logical session (for local, network, and remote 
access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an 
organizational system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user 
access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes 
associated with a user’s logical session except those processes that are specifically created 
by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or 
trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include organization-defined 
periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, and time-of-day 
restrictions on system use. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Configure the system to terminate user sessions based on the organization’s policy. Session 
termination policies can be simple or sophisticated. Examples are inactivity (end the session after a specified duration (e.g., one hour7) of inactivity), day/time (all sessions are 
terminated at the end of the established workday), misbehavior (end the session due to an 
attempted policy violation), and maintenance (terminate sessions to prevent issues with an 
upgrade or service outage). If there is no automatic control of user sessions, an attacker can 
take advantage of an unattended session. 
Example 1 
You are the system administrator for your organization and configure the system to 
terminate all user sessions after 1 hour of inactivity [a]. As the session timeout approaches, 
the system prompts users with a warning banner asking if they want to continue the session. 
When the session timeout does occur, the login page pops up, and the users must log in to 
start a new session [b]. 
Example 2 
A user is logged into a corporate database containing CUI but is not authorized to view CUI. 
The user has submitted a series of queries that unintentionally violate policy, as they attempt 
to extract CUI that the user is not authorized to view [a]. The session terminates with a 
warning as a result of a violation of corporate policy [b]. The user must reestablish the 
session before being able to submit additional legitimate queries. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the conditions in which a user session must be terminated described (e.g., after a 
period of inactivity or after a defined time limit) [a]? 
 Are procedures documented that describe how to configure the system to enable 
automatic termination of user sessions after any of the defined conditions occur [b]? 
 Are user sessions terminated based on organizationally defined conditions [a,b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Remote access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of 
users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the internet). Remote access 
methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted 
virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality over remote connections. The use 
of encrypted VPNs does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when 
adequately provisioned with appropriate control (e.g., employing encryption techniques for 
confidentiality protection), may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can 
effectively treat such connections as internal networks. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can 
affect the capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious 
code. 
Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect 
cyber-attacks and help to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of system components (e.g., servers, 
workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets). 
NIST SP 800-46, SP 800-77, and SP 800-113 provide guidance on secure remote access and 
virtual private networks. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Remote access connections pass through untrusted networks and therefore require proper 
security controls such as encryption to ensure data confidentiality. Initialization of all remote 
sessions should ensure that only authorized users and devices are connecting. After the 
remote session is established, the connection is monitored to track who is accessing the 
network remotely and what files are being accessed during the session. 
Remote access sessions can encompass more than just remote connections back to a 
headquarters network. Access to cloud-based email providers or server infrastructures also 
are relevant to this practice if those environments contain CUI. 
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.12, requires the control of remote access sessions and complements 
five other practices dealing with remote access (AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.15, 
IA.L2-3.5.3, and MA.L2-3.7.5): 
 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points. 
 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote 
sessions. 
 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote 
session. 
 IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged 
accounts. 
 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote 
maintenance sessions. 
Example 
You often need to work from remote locations, such as your home or client sites, and you are 
permitted to access your organization’s internal networks from those remote locations [a]. 
A system administrator issues you a company laptop with VPN software installed, which is 
required to connect to the networks remotely [b]. After the laptop connects to the VPN 
server, you must accept a privacy notice that states that the company’s security department 
may monitor the connection. This monitoring is achieved through the analysis of data from 
sensors on the network notifying IT if issues arise. The security department may also review 
audit logs to see who is connecting remotely, when, and what information they are accessing 
[d]. During session establishment, the message “Verifying Compliance” means software like 
a Device Health Check (DHC) application is checking the remote device to ensure it meets 
the established requirements to connect [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do policies identify when remote access is permitted and what methods must be used 
[a,b]? 
 Are systems configured to permit only approved remote access sessions (e.g., disallow 
remote access sessions by default) [c]? 
 Are automated or manual mechanisms employed for monitoring remote connections? If 
the monitoring is manual, does it occur at a frequency commensurate with the level of 
risk [d]?

[SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms protecting remote access sessions]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved 
cryptography. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A remote access session involves logging into the organization’s systems such as its internal 
network or a cloud service provider from a remote location such as home or an alternate 
work site. This remote access session must be secured using FIPS-validated cryptography to 
provide confidentiality and prevent anyone from deciphering session information 
exchanges. 
When CMMC requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. FIPS-validated 
cryptography means the cryptographic module has to have been tested and validated to 
meet FIPS 140-1 or -2 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm is not sufficient – 
the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is required 
to meet CMMC practices that protect CUI when transmitted or stored outside the protected 
environment of the covered contractor information system (including wireless/remote 
access). Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within 
the protected environment of the covered contractor information system, would not need to 
be FIPS-validated. This practice, AC.L2-3.1.13, requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms 
when enabling remote sessions and complements five other practices dealing with remote 
access (AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.15, IA.L2-3.5.3, and MA.L2-3.7.5):  
 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions.  
 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points.  
 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote 
session.  
 IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged 
accounts.  
 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote 
maintenance sessions. 
Example 
As a system administrator you are responsible for implementing a remote network access 
capability for users who work offsite. In order to provide session confidentiality, you decide 
to implement a VPN mechanism and select a product that has completed FIPS 140 validation 
[a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are cryptographic mechanisms used for remote access sessions (e.g., Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) using FIPS-validated encryption 
algorithms) defined and implemented [a,b]? Note that simply using an approved 
algorithm is not sufficient – the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement 
the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140.

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Routing remote access through managed access control points enhances explicit,

access to organizational systems resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of CUI. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The contractor can route all remote access through a limited number of remote access 
control points to reduce the attack surface and simplify network management. This allows 
for better monitoring and control of the remote connections. 
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.14, limits remote access to specific access control points and 
complements five other practices dealing with remote access (AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.13,

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
A privileged command is a human-initiated (interactively or via a process operating on 
behalf of the human) command executed on a system involving the control, monitoring, or 
administration of the system including security functions and associated security-relevant 
information. Security-relevant information is any information within the system that can 
potentially impact the operation of security functions or the provision of security services in 
a manner that could result in failure to enforce the system security policy or maintain 
isolation of code and data. Privileged commands give individuals the ability to execute 
sensitive, security-critical, or security-relevant system functions. Controlling such access 
from remote locations helps to ensure that unauthorized individuals are not able to execute 
such commands freely with the potential to do serious or catastrophic damage to 
organizational systems. Note that the ability to affect the integrity of the system is considered 
security-relevant as that could enable the means to by-pass security functions although not 
directly impacting the function itself. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Privileged users are not necessarily allowed to perform their job functions from a remote 
location. Likewise, not all privileged commands may be executed remotely. Allowing remote 
execution of privileged commands or remote access to security-relevant information should 
be avoided if possible. If absolutely necessary, the privileged commands authorized for 
remote execution should be identified and documented. Document which user roles have 
permissions to remotely execute privileged commands to make changes and to access 
security relevant information. Documentation must be used to establish security 
mechanisms that enforce the policy. 
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.15, requires authorization for privileged commands executed during 
a remote session and complements five other practices dealing with remote access (AC.L2-
3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, IA.L2-3.5.3, and MA.L2-3.7.5):  
 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions.  
 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points.  
 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote 
sessions.  
 IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-privileged 
accounts.  
 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote 
maintenance sessions.  
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.15, also extends AC.L1-3.1.2, which limits the types of transactions 
and functions that authorized users are permitted to execute. 
Example 
Your company’s Access Control Policy permits certain work roles to remotely perform a 
limited set of privileged commands from company-owned computers [a]. As a system 
administrator, you implement controls to enforce who can remotely execute a privileged 
command, which privileged commands they can execute, and who is allowed access to 
security relevant information such as audit log configuration settings [a,c,d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Does system documentation identify system administration or security functions that 
can be executed remotely [a]? 
 Is execution of the identified privileged commands via remote access only authorized for 
documented operational needs [c]?

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] wireless access points are identified; and 
[b] wireless access is authorized prior to allowing such connections. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; configuration management plan; procedures

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Wireless access management capability for the system]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Establishing usage restrictions and configuration/connection requirements for wireless 
access to the system provides criteria for organizations to support wireless access 
authorization decisions. Such restrictions and requirements reduce the susceptibility to 
unauthorized access to the system through wireless technologies. Wireless networks use 
authentication protocols that provide credential protection and mutual authentication. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Guidelines from management form the basis for the requirements that must be met prior to 
authorizing a wireless connection. These guidelines may include the following: 
 types of devices, such as corporate or privately owned equipment; 
 configuration requirements of the devices; and 
 authorization requirements before granting such connections. AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, and AC.L2-3.1.18 are complementary practices in that they all 
establish requirements to control the connection of mobile devices and wireless devices 
through the use of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. 
Example 
Your company is implementing a wireless network at its headquarters. You work with 
management to draft a policy about the use of the wireless network. The policy states that 
only company-approved devices that contain verified security configuration settings are 
allowed to connect. The policy also includes usage restrictions that must be followed for 
anyone who wants to use the wireless network. Authorization is required before devices are 
allowed to connect to the wireless network [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is an updated list of approved network devices providing wireless access to the system 
maintained [a]? 
 Are network devices providing wireless access configured to require users or devices be 
authorized prior to permitting a wireless connection [b]? 
 Is wireless access to the system authorized and managed [b]?8

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations authenticate individuals and devices to help protect wireless access to the 
system. Special attention is given to the wide variety of devices that are part of the Internet 
of Things with potential wireless access to organizational systems. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Use a combination of authentication and encryption methods to protect the access to 
wireless networks. Authenticating users to a wireless access point can be achieved in 
multiple ways. The most common authentication and encryption methods used include: 
 WPA2-PSK (WiFi Protected Access-Pre-shared Key) – This method uses a password or 
passphrase known by the wireless access point and the client (user device). It is common 
in small companies that have little turnover because the key must be changed each time 
an employee leaves in order to prevent the terminated employee from connecting to the 
network without authorization. WPA2 is typically configured to use Advanced 
Encryption Standard (AES) encryption.  WPA2 Enterprise – This method may be better for larger companies and enterprise 
networks because authentication is based on the identity of the individual user or device 
rather than a shared password or passphrase. It typically requires a Remote 
Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) server for authentication and can provide 
higher security than WPA2-PSK.  
Open authentication must not be used because it authenticates any user and lacks security 
capabilities. 
When CMMC requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. Federal 
Information Processing Standard (FIPS)-validated cryptography means the cryptographic 
module has to have been tested and validated to meet FIPS 140-1 or-2 requirements. Simply 
using an approved algorithm is not sufficient – the module (software and/or hardware) used 
to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. Accordingly, FIPS-
validated cryptography is required to meet CMMC practices that protect CUI when 
transmitted or stored outside the protected environment of the covered contractor 
information system (including wireless/remote access). Encryption used for other purposes, 
such as within applications or devices within the protected environment of the covered 
contractor information system, would not need to be FIPS-validated. 
AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, and AC.L2-3.1.18 are complementary practices in that they all 
establish requirements to control the connection of mobile devices and wireless devices 
through the use of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. 
Example 1 
You manage the wireless network at a small company and are installing a new wireless 
solution. You start by selecting a product that employs encryption validated against the 
FIPS 140 standard. You configure the wireless solution to use WPA2, requiring users to enter 
a pre-shared key to connect to the wireless network [a,b]. 
Example 2 
You manage the wireless network at a large company and are installing a new wireless 
solution. You start by selecting a product that employs encryption that is validated against 
the FIPS 140 standard. Because of the size of your workforce, you configure the wireless 
system to authenticate users with a RADIUS server. Users must provide the wireless system 
with their domain usernames and passwords to be able to connect, and the RADIUS server 
verifies those credentials. Users unable to authenticate are denied access [a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is wireless access limited only to authenticated and authorized users (e.g., required to 
supply a username and password) [a]? 
 If the organization is securing its wireless network with a pre-shared key, is access to 
that key restricted to only authorized users [a]? 
 Is wireless access encrypted using FIPS-validated cryptography? Note that simply using 
an approved algorithm is not sufficient; the module (software and/or hardware) used to 
implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140 [b].9

organizational systems]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
A mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be 
carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., 
wirelessly transmit or receive information); possesses local, non-removable or removable 
data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include 
voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture 
information, or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. 
Examples of mobile devices include smart phones, e-readers, and tablets. 
Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and 
capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different types of devices. Usage 
restrictions and implementation guidance for mobile devices include: device identification 
and authentication; configuration management; implementation of mandatory protective 
software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall); scanning devices for malicious code; 
updating virus protection software; scanning for critical software updates and patches; conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity 
checks; and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). The need to provide 
adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond this requirement. Many controls for 
mobile devices are reflected in other CUI security requirements. NIST SP 800-124 provides 
guidance on mobile device security. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Establish guidelines and acceptable practices for proper configuration, use, and management 
of mobile devices. Devices that process, store, or transmit CUI must be identified with a 
device-specific identifier. There are many different types of identifiers, and it is important to 
select one that can accommodate all devices and be used in a consistent manner. These 
identifiers are important for facilitating the required monitoring and logging function. 
In addition to smartphones, consider the security of other portable devices such as e-readers 
and tablets. 
AC.L2-3.1.16, AC.L2-3.1.17, and AC.L2-3.1.18 are complementary practices in that they all 
establish requirements to control the connection of mobile devices and wireless devices 
through the use of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms. 
Example 
Your organization has a policy stating that all mobile devices, including iPads, tablets, mobile 
phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), must be approved and registered with the 
IT department before connecting to the network. The IT department uses a Mobile Device 
Management solution to monitor mobile devices and enforce policies across the enterprise 
[b,c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is a list of mobile devices that are permitted to process, store, or transmit CUI maintained 
[a,b]? 
 Is the system configured to only permit connections from identified, authorized mobile 
devices [b]?

[a] mobile devices and mobile computing platforms that process, store, or transmit CUI are

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations can employ full-device encryption or container-based encryption to protect 
the confidentiality of CUI on mobile devices and computing platforms. Container-based 
encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data and information 
including encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields.  
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Ensure CUI is encrypted on all mobile devices and mobile computing platforms that process, 
store, or transmit CUI including smartphones, tablets, and e-readers. 
When CMMC requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. FIPS-validated 
cryptography means the cryptographic module has to have been tested and validated to 
meet FIPS 140-1 or-2 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm is not sufficient – 
the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be separately validated under FIPS 140. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is required 
to meet CMMC practices that protect CUI when transmitted or stored outside the protected 
environment of the covered contractor information system (including wireless/remote 
access). Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within 
the protected environment of the covered contractor information system, would not need to 
be FIPS-validated. 
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.19, requires that CUI be encrypted on mobile devices and extends 
three other CUI protection practices (MP.L2-3.8.1, MP.L2-3.8.2, and SC.L2-3.13.16):  
 MP.L2-3.8.1 requires that media containing CUI be protected.  
 MP.L2-3.8.2 limits access to CUI to authorized users.  
 Finally, SC.L2-3.13.16 requires confidentiality of CUI at rest.  
This practice, AC.L2-3.1.19, also leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the algorithms 
used must be FIPS-validated, and SC.L2-3.13.10, which specifies that any cryptographic keys 
in use must be protected. 
Example  
You are in charge of mobile device security. You configure all laptops to use the full-disk 
encryption technology built into the operating system. This approach is FIPS-validated and 
encrypts all files, folders, and volumes.  
Phones and tablets pose a greater technical challenge with their wide range of manufacturers 
and operating systems. You select a proprietary mobile device management (MDM) solution 
to enforce FIPS-validated encryption on those devices [a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is a list maintained of mobile devices and mobile computing platforms that are permitted 
to process, store, or transmit CUI [a]? 
 Is CUI encrypted on mobile devices using FIPS-validated algorithms [b]?

[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing restrictions on use of portable storage devices]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Limits on the use of organization-controlled portable storage devices in external systems 
include complete prohibition of the use of such devices or restrictions on how the devices 
may be used and under what conditions the devices may be used. Note that while “external” 
typically refers to outside of the organization’s direct supervision and authority that is not 
always the case. Regarding the protection of CUI across an organization, the organization 
may have systems that process CUI and others that do not. Among the systems that process 
CUI there are likely access restrictions for CUI that apply between systems. Therefore, from 
the perspective of a given system, other systems within the organization may be considered 
“external" to that system. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A portable storage device is a system component that can be inserted or attached and easily 
removed from a system. It is used to store data or information. Examples of portable storage 
devices include:  
 compact/digital video disks (CDs/DVDs); 
 Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives; 
 external hard disk drives; 
 flash memory cards/drives; and 
 floppy disks. 
This practice can be implemented in two ways: 
 identifying the portable storage device usage restrictions, identifying portable storage 
devices that may be used on external systems, identifying associated external systems on 
which a portable storage device may be used, and administratively (through the use of a 
written policy) limiting the usage of the devices to those systems; or 
 configuring devices to work only when connected to a system to which the portable 
storage device can authenticate, limiting the devices’ use on external systems to those 
that the contractor has the ability to manage. 
Example 
Your organization has a written portable device usage restriction policy. It states that users 
can only use external storage devices such as thumb dives or external hard disks that belong 
to the company. When needed for a specific business function, a user checks the device out 
from IT and returns it to IT when no longer needed [a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the portable storage devices authorized for external use identified and documented 
[a]? 
 Are the circumstances defined in which portable storage devices containing CUI may be 
used on external systems (e.g., with management approval) [b]? 
 Are limitations stipulated for the use of portable storage devices containing CUI on 
external systems (e.g., authorized personnel only, encrypted drives required) [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations determine the content and frequency of security awareness training and 
security awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the 
systems to which personnel have authorized access. The content includes a basic understanding of the need for information security and user actions to maintain security and 
to respond to suspected security incidents. The content also addresses awareness of the 
need for operations security. Security awareness techniques include: formal training; 
offering supplies inscribed with security reminders; generating email advisories or notices 
from organizational officials; displaying logon screen messages; displaying security 
awareness posters; and conducting information security awareness events. 
NIST SP 800-50 provides guidance on security awareness and training programs. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Awareness training focuses user attention on security. Several techniques can be used, such 
as:  
 synchronous or asynchronous training;  
 simulations (e.g., simulated phishing emails);  
 security awareness campaigns (posters, reminders, group discussions); and  
 communicating regular email advisories and notices to employees.  
Awareness training and role-based training are different. This practice, AT.L2-3.2.1, covers 
awareness training, which provides general security training to influence user behavior. This 
training can apply broadly or be tailored to a specific role. Role-based training focuses on the 
knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to complete a specific job and is covered by AT.L2-
3.2.2. 
Example 
You want to provide information to employees so they can identify phishing emails. To do 
this, you prepare a presentation that highlights basic traits, including: 
 suspicious-looking email address or domain name; 
 a message that contains an attachment or URL; and 
 a message that is poorly written and often contains obvious misspelled words. 
You encourage everyone to not click on attachments or links in a suspicious email [c]. You 
tell employees to forward such a message immediately to IT security [d]. You download free 
security awareness posters to hang in the office [c,d]. You send regular emails and tips to all 
employees to ensure your message is not forgotten over time [c,d].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations determine the content and frequency of security training based on the 
assigned duties, roles, and responsibilities of individuals and the security requirements of 
organizations and the systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, 
organizations provide system developers, enterprise architects, security architects, 
acquisition/procurement officials, software developers, system developers, systems 
integrators, 
system/network 
administrators, 
personnel 
conducting 
configuration 
management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and 
validation, security assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software, 
security-related technical training specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles 
and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical controls. Such training can 
include policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the security roles defined. Organizations 
also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related 
to operations and supply chain security within the context of organizational information 
security programs. 
NIST SP 800-181 provides guidance on role-based information security training in the 
workplace. SP 800-161 provides guidance on supply chain risk management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Training imparts skills and knowledge to enable staff to perform a specific job function. 
Training should be available to all employees for all organizational roles to accommodate 
role changes without being constrained by the training schedule. Awareness training and 
role-based training are different. Awareness training provides general security training to 
influence user behavior and is covered by AT.L2-3.2.1. This practice, AT.L2-3.2.2, covers role-
based training that focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to complete a 
specific job. Role-based training may include awareness topics specific to individual roles 
such as ensuring systems administrators understand the risk associated with using an 
administrative account. 
Example 
Your company upgraded the firewall to a newer, more advanced system. You have been 
identified as an employee who needs training on the new device [a,b,c]. This will enable you 
to use the firewall effectively and efficiently. Your company considered training resources 
when it planned for the upgrade and ensured that training funds were available as part of 
the upgrade project [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the duties, roles, and responsibilities that impact, directly or indirectly, the 
information security of the company or its systems defined and documented [a]? 
 Do information security-related tasks have accountable owners, and is a strictly limited 
group of individuals assigned to perform them [b]? 
 Are personnel who are assigned information security-related duties, roles, and 
responsibilities trained on those responsibilities, including the security requirements 
unique or inherent to their roles or responsibilities [c]?

AT.L2-3.2.3 – Insider Threat Awareness,AT.L2-3.2.3 – INSIDER THREAT AWARENESS,Level 2 AT Practices,|Provide security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of 
insider threat. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] potential indicators associated with insider threats are identified; and 
[b] security awareness training on recognizing and reporting potential indicators of insider 
threat is provided to managers and employees. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Security awareness and training policy; procedures addressing security 
awareness training implementation; security awareness training curriculum; security 
awareness training materials; insider threat policy and procedures; system security plan; 
other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel that participate in security awareness training; personnel with 
responsibilities for basic security awareness training; personnel with information security 
responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing insider threat training]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Potential indicators and possible precursors of insider threat include behaviors such as: 
inordinate, long-term job dissatisfaction; attempts to gain access to information that is not 
required for job performance; unexplained access to financial resources; bullying or sexual 
harassment of fellow employees; workplace violence; and other serious violations of the 
policies, procedures, directives, rules, or practices of organizations. Security awareness 
training includes how to communicate employee and management concerns regarding 
potential indicators of insider threat through appropriate organizational channels in 
accordance with established organizational policies and procedures. Organizations may 
consider tailoring insider threat awareness topics to the role (e.g., training for managers may 
be focused on specific changes in behavior of team members, while training for employees 
may be focused on more general observations). FURTHER DISCUSSION 
An insider threat is the threat that an insider will use their authorized access, wittingly or 
unwittingly, to do harm. Insider threat security awareness training focuses on recognizing 
employee behaviors and characteristics that might be indicators of an insider threat and the 
guidelines and procedures to handle and report it. Training for managers will provide 
guidance on observing team members to identify all potential threat indicators, while 
training for general employees will provide guidance for focusing on a smaller number of 
indicators. Employee behaviors will vary depending on roles, team membership, and 
associated information needs. The person responsible for specifying insider threat 
indicators must be cognizant of these factors. Because of this, organizations may choose to 
tailor the training for specific roles. This practice does not require separate training 
regarding insider threat. Organizations may choose to integrate these topics into their 
standard security awareness training programs. 
Example 
You are responsible for training all employees on the awareness of high-risk behaviors that 
can indicate a potential insider threat [b]. You educate yourself on the latest research on 
insider threat indicators by reviewing a number of law enforcement bulletins [a]. You then 
add the following example to the training package: A baseline of normal behavior for work 
schedules has been created. One employee’s normal work schedule is 8:00 AM–5:00 PM, but 
another employee noticed that the employee has been working until 9:00 PM every day even 
though no projects requiring additional hours have been assigned [b]. The observing 
employee reports the abnormal work schedule using the established reporting guidelines. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do training materials include potential indicators associated with insider threats (e.g., 
repeated security violations, unusual work hours, unexpected significant transfers of 
data, suspicious contacts, concerning behaviors outside the workplace) [a,b]? 
 Do training materials include methods of reporting potential indicators of insider threats 
to management or responsible security personnel [b]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system audit logging]. DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
An event is any observable occurrence in a system, which includes unlawful or unauthorized 
system activity. Organizations identify event types for which a logging functionality is 
needed as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the 
environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing auditing needs. 
Event types can include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to 
systems, administrative privilege usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining 
event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing 
appropriate for each of the CUI security requirements. Monitoring and auditing 
requirements can be balanced with other system needs. For example, organizations may 
determine that systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and 
unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the 
potential burden on system performance. 
Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level 
as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a 
critical aspect of an audit logging capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes 
to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of event types, the logging necessary to 
cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., 
processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in 
service-oriented or cloud-based architectures. 
Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes time stamps, 
source and destination addresses, user or process identifiers, event descriptions, success or 
failure indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked. 
Event outcomes can include indicators of event success or failure and event-specific results 
(e.g., the security state of the system after the event occurred). 
Detailed information that organizations may consider in audit records includes full text 
recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users. 
Organizations consider limiting the additional audit log information to only that information 
explicitly needed for specific audit requirements. This facilitates the use of audit trails and 
audit logs by not including information that could potentially be misleading or could make it 
more difficult to locate information of interest. Audit logs are reviewed and analyzed as often 
as needed to provide important information to organizations to facilitate risk-based decision 
making. NIST SP 800-92 provides guidance on security log management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Contractors must ensure that all applicable systems create and retain audit logs that contain 
enough information to identify and investigate potentially unlawful or unauthorized system 
activity. Contractors must define the audit logs it needs to collect as well as the specific 
events to capture within the selected logs. Captured audit records are checked to verify that 
they contain the required events. 
In defining the audit log retention period, contractors must ensure that logs are retained for 
a sufficiently long period to allow for the investigation of a security event. The retention 
period must take into account the delay of weeks or months that can occur between an initial 
compromise and the discovery of attacker activity. 
 
 
Example 
You set up audit logging capability for your company. You determine that all systems that 
contain CUI must have extra detail in the audit logs. Because of this, you configure these 
systems to log the following information for all user actions [b,c]: 
 time stamps; 
 source and destination addresses; 
 user or process identifiers; 
 event descriptions; 
 success or fail indications; and 
 filenames. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are audit log retention requirements appropriate to the system and its associated level 
of risk [e]?

documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system audit logging]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement ensures that the contents of the audit record include the information 
needed to link the audit event to the actions of an individual to the extent feasible. 
Organizations consider logging for traceability including results from monitoring of account 
usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, communications at 
system boundaries, configuration settings, physical access, nonlocal maintenance, use of 
maintenance tools, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, system 
component inventory, use of mobile code, and use of VoIP. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Capturing the necessary information in audit logs ensures that you can trace actions to a 
specific user. This may include capturing user IDs, source and destination addresses, and time stamps. Logging from networks, servers, clients, and applications should be considered 
in ensuring accountability. 
This practice, AU.L2-3.3.2, which ensures logging and traceability of user actions, supports 
the control of non-privileged users required by AC.L2-3.1.7 as well as many other auditing, 
configuration management, incident response, and situation awareness practices. 
Example 
You are a system administrator. You want to ensure that you can trace all remote access 
sessions to a specific user. You configure the VPN device to capture the following information 
for all remote access connections: source and destination IP address, user ID, machine name, 
time stamp, and user actions during the remote session [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are users uniquely traced and held responsible for unauthorized actions [a]? 
 Does the system protect against an individual denying having performed an action (non- 
repudiation) [b]?11

AU.L2-3.3.3 – Event Review,AU.L2-3.3.3 – EVENT REVIEW,Level 2 AU Practices,|Review and update logged events. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] a process for determining when to review logged events is defined; 
[b] event types being logged are reviewed in accordance with the defined review process; 
and 
[c] event types being logged are updated based on the review. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; procedures addressing audit records and 
event types; system security plan; list of organization-defined event types to be logged; 
reviewed and updated records of logged event types; system audit logs and records; system 
incident reports; other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting review and update of logged event types]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
The intent of this requirement is to periodically re-evaluate which logged events will 
continue to be included in the list of events to be logged. The event types that are logged by 
organizations may change over time. Reviewing and updating the set of logged event types 
periodically is necessary to ensure that the current set remains necessary and sufficient. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
This practice is focused on the configuration of the auditing system, not the review of the 
audit records produced by the selected events. The review of the audit logs is covered under 
AU.L2-3.3.5 and AU.L2-3.3.6. 
Example 
You are in charge of IT operations for your company and are responsible for identifying and 
documenting which events are relevant to the security of your company’s systems. Your company has decided that this list of events should be updated annually or when new 
security threats or events have been identified, which may require additional events to be 
logged and reviewed [a]. The list of events you are capturing in your logs started as the list 
of recommended events given by the manufacturers of your operating systems and devices, 
but it has grown from experience. 
Your company experiences a security incident, and a forensics review shows the logs appear 
to have been deleted by a remote user. You notice that remote sessions are not currently 
being logged [b]. You update the list of events to include logging all VPN sessions [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do documented processes include methods for determining when to review logged event 
types (i.e., regular frequency, after incidents, after major system changes) [a]? 
 Do documented processes include methods for reviewing event types being logged (i.e., 
based on specific threat, use case, retention capacity, current utilization, and/or newly 
added system component or functionality) [b]?

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; system or network administrators; system 
developers]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing system response to audit logging process 
failures]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Audit logging process failures include software and hardware errors, failures in the audit 
record capturing mechanisms, and audit record storage capacity being reached or exceeded. 
This requirement applies to each audit record data storage repository (i.e., distinct system 
component where audit records are stored), the total audit record storage capacity of 
organizations (i.e., all audit record data storage repositories combined), or both.  
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Audit logging keeps track of activities occurring on the network, servers, user workstations, 
and other components of the overall system. These logs must always be available and 
functional. The company’s designated security personnel (e.g., system administrator and security officer) need to be aware when the audit log process fails or becomes unavailable 
[a]. Notifications (e.g., email, Short Message Service (SMS)) should to be sent to the 
company’s designated security personnel to immediately take appropriate action. If security 
personnel are unaware of the audit logging process failure, then they will be unaware of any 
suspicious activity occurring at that time. Response to an audit logging process failure should 
account for the extent of the failure (e.g., a single component’s audit logging versus failure of 
the centralized logging solution), the risks involved in this loss of audit logging, and other 
factors (e.g., the possibility that an adversary could have caused the audit logging process 
failure). 
Example 
You are in charge of IT operations for your company, and your responsibilities include 
managing the audit logging process. You configure your systems to send you an email in the 
event of an audit log failure. One day, you receive one of these alerts. You connect to the 
system, restart logging, and determine why the logging stopped [a,b,c].

 Will the system alert personnel with security responsibilities in the event of an audit 
processing failure?12

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to 
indications of unlawful, unauthorized, suspicious, or unusual activity are defined; and 
[b] defined audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes are correlated.

personnel with information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting analysis and correlation of audit records;

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Correlating audit record review, analysis, and reporting processes helps to ensure that they 
do not operate independently, but rather collectively. Regarding the assessment of a given 
organizational system, the requirement is agnostic as to whether this correlation is applied 
at the system level or at the organization level across all systems. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Companies must review, analyze, and report audit records to help detect and respond to 
security incidents in a timely manner for the purpose of investigation and corrective actions. 
Collection of audit logs into one or more central repositories may facilitate correlated review. 
Small companies may be able to accomplish this manually with well-defined and -managed 
procedures. Larger companies will use an automated system for analysis that correlates log 
data from across the entire enterprise. Some companies may want to orchestrate the analysis process to include the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for collection, 
correlation, and the automation of responses based on programed rulesets. 
Example 
You are a member of a cyber defense team responsible for audit log analysis. You run an 
automated tool that analyzes all the audit logs across a Local Area Network (LAN) segment 
simultaneously looking for similar anomalies on separate systems at separate locations. 
After extracting anomalous information and performing a correlation analysis [b], you 
determine that four different systems have had their event log information cleared between 
2:00 AM to 3:00 AM, although the associated dates are different. The team monitors all 
systems on the same LAN segment between 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM for the next 30 days.

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with audit record reduction and report generation 
responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Audit record reduction and report generation capability]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Audit record reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and 
organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit 
record reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same 
system or organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit record reduction 
capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data 
filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability 
provided by the system can help generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit 
records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the time stamp in the record is 
insufficient. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Raw audit log data is difficult to review, analyze, and report because of the volume of data. 
Audit record reduction is an automated process that interprets raw audit log data and 
extracts meaningful and relevant information without altering the original logs. An example of log reduction for files to be analyzed would be the removal of details associated with 
nightly backups. Report generation on reduced log information allows you to create succinct 
customized reports without the need to burden the reader with unimportant information. In 
addition, the security-relevant audit information must be made available to personnel on 
demand for immediate review, analysis, reporting, and event investigation support. 
Performing audit log reduction and providing on-demand reports may allow the analyst to 
take mitigating action before an adversary completes its malicious actions. 
Example 
You are in charge of IT operations in your company. You are responsible for providing audit 
record reduction and report generation capability. To support this function, you deploy an 
open-source solution that will collect and analyze data for signs of anomalies. The solution 
queries your central log repository to extract relevant data and provide you with a concise 
and comprehensive view for further analysis to identify potentially malicious activity [a]. In 
addition to creating on-demand data sets for analysis, you create customized reports 
explaining the contents of the data set [b].

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing time stamp generation; mechanisms 
implementing internal information system clock synchronization]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Internal system clocks are used to generate time stamps, which include date and time. Time 
is expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich 
Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. The granularity of time 
measurements refers to the degree of synchronization between system clocks and reference 
clocks, for example, clocks synchronizing within hundreds of milliseconds or within tens of 
milliseconds. Organizations may define different time granularities for different system 
components. Time service can also be critical to other security capabilities such as access 
control and identification and authentication, depending on the nature of the mechanisms 
used to support those capabilities. This requirement provides uniformity of time stamps for 
systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Each system must synchronize its time with a central time server to ensure that all systems 
are recording audit logs using the same time source. Reviewing audit logs from multiple 
systems can be a difficult task if time is not synchronized. Systems can be synchronized to a 
network device or directory service or configured manually. 
Example 
You are setting up several new computers on your company’s network. You update the time 
settings on each machine to use the same authoritative time server on the internet [b,c]. 
When you review audit logs, all your machines will have synchronized time, which aids in 
any potential security investigations. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Can the records’ time stamps map to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), compare system 
clocks with authoritative Network Time Protocol (NTP) servers, and synchronize system 
clocks when the time difference is greater than 1 second [c]?15

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit log settings, and audit 
reports) needed to successfully audit system activity. Audit logging tools are those programs 
and devices used to conduct audit and logging activities. This requirement focuses on the 
technical protection of audit information and limits the ability to access and execute audit 
logging tools to authorized individuals. Physical protection of audit information is addressed 
by media protection and physical and environmental protection requirements. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Audit information is a critical record of what events occurred, the source of the events, and 
the outcomes of the events; this information needs to be protected. The logs must be 
properly secured so that the information may not be modified or deleted, either intentionally 
or unintentionally. Only those with a legitimate need-to-know should have access to audit 
information, whether that information is being accessed directly from logs or from audit 
tools. 
Example 
You are in charge of IT operations in your company. Your responsibilities include protecting 
audit information and audit logging tools. You protect the information from modification or 
deletion by having audit log events forwarded to a central server and by restricting the local 
audit logs to only be viewable by the system administrators [a,b,c]. Only a small group of 
security professionals can view the data on the central audit server [b,c,d]. For an additional 
layer of protection, you back up the server daily and encrypt the backups before sending 
them to a cloud data repository [a,b,c].

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] a subset of privileged users granted access to manage audit logging functionality is 
defined; and 
[b] management of audit logging functionality is limited to the defined subset of privileged 
users. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Audit and accountability policy; access control policy and procedures; 
procedures addressing protection of audit information; system security plan; system design 
documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; access 
authorizations; system-generated list of privileged users with access to management of audit 
logging functionality; access control list; system audit logs and records; other relevant 
documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with audit and accountability responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; system or network administrators; system 
developers]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms managing access to audit logging functionality]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Individuals with privileged access to a system and who are also the subject of an audit by 
that system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit logging 
activities or modifying audit records. This requirement specifies that privileged access be 
further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users 
with audit-related privileges. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Companies should restrict access to audit logging functions to a limited number of privileged 
users who can modify audit logs and audit settings. General users should not be granted 
permissions to perform audit management. All audit managers should be privileged users, 
but only a small subset of privileged users will be given audit management responsibilities. Functions performed by privileged users must be distinctly separate from the functions 
performed by users who have audit-related responsibilities to reduce the potential of 
fraudulent activities by privileged users not being detected or reported. When possible, 
individuals who manage audit logs should not have access to other privileged functions. 
Example 
You are a junior system administrator responsible for the administration of select company 
infrastructure, but you are not responsible for managing audit information. You are not 
permitted to review audit logs, delete audit logs, or modify audit log settings [b]. Full control 
of audit logging functions has been given to senior system administrators [a,b]. This 
separation of system administration duties from audit logging management is necessary to 
prevent possible log file tampering. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are audit records of nonlocal accesses to privileged accounts and the execution of 
privileged functions protected [b]?17

[a] a baseline configuration is established; 
[b] the baseline configuration includes hardware, software, firmware, and documentation; 
[c] the baseline configuration is maintained (reviewed and updated) throughout the

mechanisms supporting configuration control of the baseline configuration; organizational 
processes for developing and documenting an inventory of system components;

the system inventory]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement establishes and maintains baseline configurations for systems and system 
components including for system communications and connectivity. Baseline configurations 
are documented, formally reviewed, and agreed-upon sets of specifications for systems or 
configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future 
builds, releases, and changes to systems. Baseline configurations include information about 
system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook 
computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and 
update and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration 
settings and parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components 
within the system architecture. Baseline configurations of systems also reflect the current 
enterprise architecture. Maintaining effective baseline configurations requires creating new 
baselines as organizational systems change over time. Baseline configuration maintenance 
includes reviewing and updating the baseline configuration when changes are made based 
on security risks and deviations from the established baseline configuration. 
Organizations can implement centralized system component inventories that include 
components from multiple organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure 
that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper 
component accountability (e.g., system association, system owner). Information deemed 
necessary for effective accountability of system components includes hardware inventory 
specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component owners, 
and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. 
Inventory specifications include manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and 
physical location. 
NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on security-focused configuration management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
An effective cybersecurity program depends on consistent, secure system and component 
configuration and management. Build and configure systems from a known, secure, and 
approved configuration baseline. This includes: 
 documenting the software and configuration settings of a system; 
 placement within the network; and 
 other specifications as required by the organization. 
Example 
You are in charge of upgrading the computer operating systems of your office’s computers. 
You research how to set up and configure a workstation with the least functionality and 
highest security and use that as the framework for creating a configuration that minimizes 
functionality while still allowing users to do their tasks. After testing the new baseline on a 
single workstation, you document this configuration and apply it to the other computers [a]. 
You then check to make sure that the software changes are accurately reflected in your 
master system inventory [e]. Finally, you set a calendar reminder to review the baseline in 
three months [f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do baseline configurations include software versions and patch level, configuration 
parameters, network information, and communications with connected systems [a,b]?18 
 Are baseline configurations updated as needed to accommodate security risks or 
software changes [c]?19

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] security configuration settings for information technology products employed in the

POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Configuration management policy; baseline configuration; procedures

configurations]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, 
or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture or functionality of the 
system. Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings 
can be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, input and output 
devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, 
gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), 
operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of systems including 
the parameters required to satisfy other security requirements. Security parameters include: 
registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, 
ports, protocols, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide 
configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. 
The established settings become part of the systems configuration baseline. 
Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, 
lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical 
implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that 
stipulate 
secure 
configuration 
settings 
for 
specific 
information 
technology 
platforms/products and instructions for configuring those system components to meet 
operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of 
organizations including information technology product developers, manufacturers, 
vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the 
public and private sectors. 
NIST SP 800-70 and SP 800-128 provide guidance on security configuration settings. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Information security is an integral part of a company’s configuration management process. 
Security-related configuration settings are customized to satisfy the company’s security 
requirements and are applied them to all systems once tested and approved. The 
configuration settings must reflect the most restrictive settings that are appropriate for the 
system. Any required deviations from the baseline are reviewed, documented, and approved.  
Example 
You manage baseline configurations for your company’s systems. As part of this, you 
download a secure configuration guide for each of your asset types (servers, workstations, 
network components, operating systems, middleware, and applications) from a well-known 
and trusted IT security organization. You then apply all of the settings that you can while still 
ensuring the assets can perform the role for which they are needed. Once you have the 
configuration settings identified and tested, you document them to ensure all applicable 
machines can be configured the same way [a,b].  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do security settings reflect the most restrictive settings appropriate [a]?20  
 Are changes or deviations to security settings documented [b]?21

[a] changes to the system are tracked; 
[b] changes to the system are reviewed; 
[c] changes to the system are approved or disapproved; and 
[d] changes to the system are logged.

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for configuration change control; mechanisms that

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Tracking, reviewing, approving/disapproving, and logging changes is called configuration 
change control. Configuration change control for organizational systems involves the 
systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of 
changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change 
control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items 
of systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., 
operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled and 
unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. 
Processes for managing configuration changes to systems include Configuration Control 
Boards or Change Advisory Boards that review and approve proposed changes to systems. For new development systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations 
consider including representatives from development organizations on the Configuration 
Control Boards or Change Advisory Boards. Audit logs of changes include activities before 
and after changes are made to organizational systems and the activities required to 
implement such changes. 
NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on configuration change control. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
You must track, review, and approve configuration changes before committing to 
production. Changes to computing environments can create unintended and unforeseen 
issues that can affect the security and availability of the systems. Relevant experts and 
stakeholders must review and approve proposed changes. They should discuss potential 
impacts before the organization puts the changes in place. Relevant items include changes to 
the physical environment and to the systems hosted within it. 
Example 
Once a month, the management and technical team leads join a change control board 
meeting. During this meeting, everyone reviews all proposed changes to the environment 
[b,c]. This includes changes to the physical and computing environments. The meeting 
ensures that relevant subject-matter experts review changes and propose alternatives 
where needed. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are changes to the system authorized by company management and documented 
[a,b,c,d]?22 
 Are changes documented and tracked (e.g., manually written down or included in a 
tracking service such as a ticketing system) [d]?

CM.L2-3.4.4 – Security Impact Analysis,CM.L2-3.4.4 – SECURITY IMPACT ANALYSIS,Level 2 CM Practices,|Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A]

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security impact analysis]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizational personnel with information security responsibilities (e.g., system 
administrators, system security officers, system security managers, and systems security 
engineers) conduct security impact analyses. Individuals conducting security impact 
analyses possess the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to 
systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include 
reviewing security plans to understand security requirements and reviewing system design 
documentation to understand the implementation of controls and how specific changes 
might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include risk assessments to 
better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional controls are 
required. 
NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on configuration change control and security impact 
analysis. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Changes to complex environments are reviewed for potential security impact before 
implemented. Changes to IT systems can cause unforeseen problems and have unintended 
consequences for both users and the security of the operating environment. Analyze the security impact of changes prior to implementing them. This can uncover and mitigate 
potential problems before they occur. 
Example 
You have been asked to deploy a new web browser plug-in. Your standard change 
management process requires that you produce a detailed plan for the change, including a 
review of its potential security impact. A subject-matter expert who did not submit the 
change reviews the plan and tests the new plug-in for functionality and security. You update 
the change plan based on the expert’s findings and submit it to the change control board for 
final approval [a].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Any changes to the hardware, software, or firmware components of systems can potentially 
have significant effects on the overall security of the systems. Therefore, organizations 
permit only qualified and authorized individuals to access systems for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications. Access restrictions for change also include 
software libraries. Access restrictions include physical and logical access control 
requirements, workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes 
implemented into external interfaces rather than directly into systems), and change 
windows (e.g., changes occur only during certain specified times). In addition to security 
concerns, commonly-accepted due diligence for configuration management includes access 
restrictions as an essential part in ensuring the ability to effectively manage the 
configuration. 
NIST SP 800-128 provides guidance on configuration change control. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Define, identify, and document qualified individuals authorized to make physical and logical 
changes to the organization’s hardware, software, software libraries, or firmware 
components. Control of configuration management activities may involve: 
 physical access control that prohibits unauthorized users from gaining physical access to 
an asset (e.g., requiring a special key card to enter a server room); 
 logical access control that prevents unauthorized users from logging onto a system to 
make configuration changes (e.g., requiring specific credentials for modifying 
configuration settings, patching software, or updating software libraries); 
 workflow automation in which configuration management workflow rules define human 
tasks and data or files are routed between people authorized to do configuration 
management based on pre-defined business rules (e.g., passing an electronic form to a 
manager requesting approval of configuration change made by an authorized employee); 
 an abstraction layer for configuration management that requires changes be made from 
an external system through constrained interface (e.g., software updates can only be 
made from a patch management system with a specific IP address); and 
 utilization of a configuration management change window (e.g., software updates are 
only allowed between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM or between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM). 
Example 
Your datacenter requires expanded storage capacity in a server. The change has been 
approved, and security is planning to allow an external technician to access the building at a 
specific date and time under the supervision of a manager [a,b,c,d]. A system administrator 
creates a temporary privileged account that can be used to log into the server’s operating 
system and update storage settings [e,f,g]. On the appointed day, the technician is escorted 
into the datacenter, upgrades the hardware, expands the storage in the operating system 
(OS), and departs. The manager verifies the upgrade and disables the privileged account [h]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are only employees who are approved to make physical or logical changes on systems 
allowed to do so [a,d,e,h]?24 
 Are authorized personnel approved and documented by the service owner and IT 
security [a,e]?25 
 Does all change documentation include the name of the authorized employee making the 
change [b,d,f,h]?26

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes prohibiting or restricting functions, ports, 
protocols, or services; mechanisms implementing restrictions or prohibition of functions, 
ports, protocols, or services]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and 
services routinely provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential 
organizational missions, functions, or operations. It is sometimes convenient to provide 
multiple services from single system components. However, doing so increases risk over 
limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit 
component functionality to a single function per component. 
Organizations review functions and services provided by systems or components of systems, 
to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination. Organizations 
disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent 
unauthorized connection of devices, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations 
can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify 
and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
You should customize organizational systems to remove non-essential applications and 
disable unnecessary services. Systems come with many unnecessary applications and 
settings enabled by default including unused ports and protocols. Leave only the fewest 
capabilities necessary for the systems to operate effectively. 
Example 
You have ordered a new server, which has arrived with a number of free utilities installed in 
addition to the operating system. Before you deploy the server, you research the utilities to 
determine which ones can be eliminated without impacting functionality. You remove the 
unneeded software, then move on to disable unused ports and services. The server that 
enters production therefore has only the essential capabilities enabled for the system to 
function in its role [a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the roles and functions for each system identified along with the software and 
services required to perform those functions [a]? 
 Are the software and services required for those defined functions identified [a]? 
 Is the information system configured to exclude any function not needed in the 
operational environment [b]?27

software program usage and restrictions; mechanisms supporting or implementing software 
program usage and restrictions; mechanisms preventing program execution on the system]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Restricting the use of nonessential software (programs) includes restricting the roles 
allowed to approve program execution; prohibiting auto-execute; program blacklisting and 
whitelisting; or restricting the number of program instances executed at the same time. The 
organization makes a security-based determination which functions, ports, protocols, 
and/or services are restricted. Bluetooth, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and peer-to-peer 
networking are examples of protocols organizations consider preventing the use of, 
restricting, or disabling. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Organizations should only use the minimum set of programs, services, ports, and protocols 
required for to accomplish the organization’s mission. This has several implications: 
 All unnecessary programs and accounts are removed from all endpoints and servers. 
 The organization makes a policy decision to control the execution of programs through 
either whitelisting or blacklisting. Whitelisting means a program can only run if the 
software has been vetted in some way, and the executable name has been entered onto a 
list of allowed software. Blacklisting means any software can execute as long it is not on 
a list of known malicious software. Whitelisting provides far more security than 
blacklisting, but the organization’s policy can direct the implementation of either 
approach. Control of execution applies to both servers and endpoints. 
 The organization restricts the use of all unnecessary ports, protocols, and system services 
in order to limit entry points that attackers can use. For example, the use of the FTP 
service is eliminated from all computers, and the associated ports are blocked unless a 
required service utilizes those ports. The elimination of nonessential functionality on the 
network and systems provides a smaller attack surface for an attacker to gain access and 
take control of your network or systems. 
This practice, CM.L2-3.4.7, which requires limiting functionality to essential programs, ports, 
protocols, and services, extends CM.L2-3.4.6, which requires adherence to the principle of 
least functionality but does not specifically address which elements of a system should be 
limited. 
Example 
You are responsible for purchasing new endpoint hardware, installing organizationally 
required software to the hardware, and configuring the endpoint in accordance with the 
organization’s policy. The organization has a system imaging capability that loads all 
necessary software, but it does not remove unnecessary services, eliminate the use of certain 
protocols, or close unused ports. After imaging the systems, you close all ports and block the 
use of all protocols except the following: 
 TCP for SSH on port 22; 
 SMTP on port 25; 
 TCP and UDP on port 53; and 
 HTTP and HTTPS on port 443. 
The use of any other ports or protocols are allowed by exception only [i,l,o]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations

software. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] a policy specifying whether whitelisting or blacklisting is to be implemented is 
specified; 
[b] the software allowed to execute under whitelisting or denied use under blacklisting is

functionality in the system; system security plan; configuration management plan; system 
design documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; list of

or whitelisting; mechanisms supporting or implementing blacklisting or whitelisting]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
The process used to identify software programs that are not authorized to execute on 
systems is commonly referred to as blacklisting. The process used to identify software 
programs that are authorized to execute on systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. 
Whitelisting is the stronger of the two policies for restricting software program execution. In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of whitelisted 
software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash 
functions. Verification of whitelisted software can occur either prior to execution or at 
system startup. 
NIST SP 800-167 provides guidance on application whitelisting. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Organizations should determine their blacklisting or whitelisting policy and configure the 
system to manage software that is allowed to run. Blacklisting or deny-by-exception allows 
all software to run except if on an unauthorized software list such as what is maintained in 
antivirus solutions. Whitelisting or permit-by-exception does not allow any software to run 
except if on an authorized software list. The stronger policy of the two is whitelisting. 
This practice, CM.L2-3.4.8, requires the implementation of allow-lists and deny-lists for 
application software. It leverages CM.L2-3.4.1, which requires the organization to establish 
and maintain software inventories.  
This practice, CM.L2-3.4.8, also extends CM.L2-3.4.9, which only requires control and 
monitoring of any user installed software. 
Example 
To improve your company’s protection from malware, you have decided to allow only 
designated programs to run. With additional research you identify a capability within the 
latest operating system that can control executables, scripts, libraries, or application 
installers run in your environment [c]. To ensure success you begin by authorizing digitally 
signed executables. Once they are deployed, you then plan to evaluate and deploy 
whitelisting for software libraries and scripts [c].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Users can install software in organizational systems if provided the necessary privileges. To 
maintain control over the software installed, organizations identify permitted and 
prohibited actions regarding software installation through policies. Permitted software 
installations include updates and security patches to existing software and applications from 
organization-approved “app stores.” Prohibited software installations may include software 
with unknown or suspect pedigrees or software that organizations consider potentially 
malicious. The policies organizations select governing user-installed software may be 
organization-developed or provided by some external entity. Policy enforcement methods 
include procedural methods, automated methods, or both. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Software that users have the ability to install is limited to items that the organization 
approves. When not controlled, users could install software that can create unnecessary risk. 
This risk applies both to the individual machine and to the larger operating environment. 
Policies and technical controls reduce risk to the organization by preventing users from 
installing unauthorized software. 
Example 
You are a system administrator. A user calls you for help installing a software package. They 
are receiving a message asking for a password because they do not have permission to install 
the software. You explain that the policy prohibits users from installing software without 
approval [a]. When you set up workstations for users, you do not provide administrative 
privileges. After the call, you redistribute the policy to all users ensuring everyone in the 
company is aware of the restrictions. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are user controls in place to prohibit the installation of unauthorized software [a]?36 
 Is all software in use on the information systems approved [b]?37 
 Is there a mechanism in place to monitor the types of software a user is permitted to 
download (e.g., is there a white list of approved software) [c]?

IA.L1-3.5.1 – Identification,Identification and Authentication (IA),Level 1 IA Practices,|Identify information system users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] system users are identified;

[c] devices accessing the system are identified.

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for uniquely identifying and authenticating users; 
mechanisms supporting or implementing identification and authentication capability]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Common device identifiers include media access control (MAC), Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses, or device-unique token identifiers. Management of individual identifiers is not 
applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the user names 
associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Organizations may 
require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability 
of individual activity. In addition, this requirement addresses individual identifiers that are 
not necessarily associated with system accounts. Organizational devices requiring identification may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. NIST SP 
800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Make sure to assign individual, unique identifiers (e.g., user names) to all users and 
processes that access company systems. Authorized devices also should have unique 
identifiers. Unique identifiers can be as simple as a short set of alphanumeric characters (e.g., 
SW001 could refer to a network switch, SW002 could refer to a different network switch).  
This practice, IA.L1-3.5.1, provides a vetted and trusted identity that supports the access 
control mechanism required by AC.L1-3.1.1. 
Example 
You want to make sure that all employees working on a project can access important 
information about it. Because this is work for the DoD and may contain FCI, you also need to 
prevent employees who are not working on that project from being able to access the 
information. You assign each employee is assigned a unique user ID, which they use to log 
into the system [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are unique identifiers issued to individual users (e.g., usernames) [a]? 
 Are the processes and service accounts that an authorized user initiates identified (e.g., 
scripts, automatic updates, configuration updates, vulnerability scans) [b]? 
 Are unique device identifiers used for devices that access the system identified [c]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing authenticator management

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Individual authenticators include the following: passwords, key cards, cryptographic 
devices, and one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content is the actual content 
of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about 
authenticator content include the minimum password length. Developers ship system 
components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation 
and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily 
discoverable, and present a significant security risk. 
Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and 
restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length, 
validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed 
rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator 
management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators 
include certificates and passwords. 
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Before you let a person or a device have access to your system, verify that the user or device 
is who or what it claims to be. This verification is called authentication. The most common 
way to verify identity is using a username and a hard-to-guess password. 
Some devices ship with default usernames and passwords. For example, some devices ship 
so that when you first log on to the device, the username is “admin” and the password is 
“admin”. When you have devices with this type of default username and password, 
immediately change the default password to a unique password you create. Default 
passwords may be well known to the public, easily found in a search, or easy to guess, 
allowing an unauthorized person to access your system. 
Example 1 
You are in charge of purchasing. You know that some laptops come with a default username 
and password. You notify IT that all default passwords should be reset prior to laptop use 
[a]. You ask IT to explain the importance of resetting default passwords and convey how 
easily they are discovered using internet searches during next week’s cybersecurity 
awareness training. 
Example 2 
Your company decides to use cloud services for email and other capabilities. Upon reviewing 
this practice, you realize every user or device that connects to the cloud service must be 
authenticated. As a result, you work with your cloud service provider to ensure that only 
properly authenticated users and devices are allowed to connect to the system [a,c].  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are unique authenticators used to verify user identities (e.g., passwords) [a]? 
 An example of a process acting on behalf of users could be a script that logs in as a person 
or service account [b]. Can the contractor show that it maintains a record of all of those 
service accounts for use when reviewing log data or responding to an incident? 
 Are user credentials authenticated in system processes (e.g., credentials binding, 
certificates, tokens) [b]? 
 Are device identifiers used in authentication processes (e.g., MAC address, non-
anonymous computer name, certificates) [c]?

[c] multifactor authentication is implemented for network access to privileged accounts;

information security responsibilities; system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing authenticator management 
capability]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to authenticate. 
The factors are defined as something you know (e.g., password, personal identification 
number [PIN]); something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or 
something you are (e.g., biometric). Multifactor authentication solutions that feature 
physical authenticators include hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-
response authenticators and smart cards. In addition to authenticating users at the system 
level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Access to 
organizational systems is defined as local access or network access. Local access is any access 
to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access 
is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to 
systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained 
through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network 
access that involves communication through external networks. The use of encrypted virtual 
private networks for connections between organization-controlled and non-organization 
controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with regard to protecting the 
confidentiality of information. 
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Implement a combination of two or more factors of authentication to verify privileged 
account holders’ identity regardless of how the user is accessing the account. Implement a 
combination of two or more factors for non-privileged users accessing the system over a 
network. 
The implementation of multi-factor authentication will depend on the environment and 
business needs. Although two-factor authentication directly on the computer is most 
common, there are situations (e.g., multi-factor identification for a mission system that 
cannot be altered) where additional technical or physical solutions can provide security. 
Multifactor authentication is not required for access to mobile devices such as smartphones 
or tablets – which are not considered to be network devices or information systems. 
This practice, IA.L2-3.5.3, requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-
privileged accounts and complements five other practices dealing with remote access 
(AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.15, and MA.L2-3.7.5:  
 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions.  
 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points.  
 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote 
sessions.  
 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote.  
 Finally, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote 
maintenance sessions. 
This practice, IA.L2-3.5.3, also enhances IA.L1-3.5.2, which is a requirement for a less 
rigorous form of user authentication. 
Example 
You decide to implement multifactor authentication (MFA) to improve security of your 
network. Your first step is enabling MFA on VPN access to your internal network [c,d]. When 
users initiate remote access, they will be prompted for the additional authentication factor. 
Because you also use a cloud-based email solution, you require MFA for access to that 
resource as well [c,d]. Finally, you enable MFA for both local and network logins for the 
system administrator accounts used to patch and manage servers [a,b,c].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Authentication processes resist replay attacks if it is impractical to successfully authenticate 
by recording or replaying previous authentication messages. Replay-resistant techniques 
include protocols that use nonces or challenges such as time synchronous or challenge-
response one-time authenticators. 
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
When insecure protocols are used for access to computing resources, an adversary may be 
able to capture login information and immediately reuse (replay) it for other purposes. It is 
important to use mechanisms that resist this technique. Example 
To protect your IT infrastructure, you understand that the methods for authentication must 
not be easily copied and re-sent to your systems by an adversary. You select Kerberos for 
authentication because of its built-in resistance to replay attacks. As a next step you upgrade 
all of your web applications to require Transport Layer Security (TLS), which also is replay-
resistant. Your use of MFA to protect remote access also confers some replay resistance.

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Identifiers are provided for users, processes acting on behalf of users, or devices (IA.L1-
3.5.1). Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used 
individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Identifiers uniquely associate a user ID to an individual, group, role, or device. Establish 
guidelines and implement mechanisms to prevent identifiers from being reused for the 
period of time established in the policy. 
Example 
As a system administrator, you maintain a central directory/domain that holds the accounts 
for users, computers, and network devices. As part of your job, you issue unique usernames (e.g., riley@acme.com) for the staff to access resources. When you issue staff computers you 
also rename the computer to reflect to whom it is assigned (e.g., riley-laptop01). Riley has 
recently left the organization, so you must manage the former staff member’s account. 
Incidentally, their replacement is also named Riley. In the directory, you do not assign the 
previous account to the new user, as policy has defined an identifier reuse period of 24 
months [a]. In accordance with policy, you create an account called riley02 [b]. This account 
is assigned the appropriate permissions for the new user. A new laptop is also provided with 
the identifier of riley02-laptop01.

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing identifier management]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Inactive identifiers pose a risk to organizational information because attackers may exploit 
an inactive identifier to gain undetected access to organizational devices. The owners of the 
inactive accounts may not notice if unauthorized access to the account has been obtained. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Identifiers are uniquely associated with an individual, account, process, or device. An 
inactive identifier is one that has not been used for a defined extended period of time. For 
example, a user account may be needed for a certain time to allow for transition of business 
processes to existing or new staff. Once use of the identifier is no longer necessary, it should 
be disabled as soon as possible. Failure to maintain awareness of accounts that are no longer 
needed yet still active could allow an adversary to exploit IT services. Example 
One of your responsibilities is to enforce your company’s inactive account policy: any

IA.L2-3.5.7 – Password Complexity,IA.L2-3.5.7 – PASSWORD COMPLEXITY,Level 2 IA Practices,|Enforce a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new passwords 
are created. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] password complexity requirements are defined; 
[b] password change of character requirements are defined; 
[c] minimum password complexity requirements as defined are enforced when new 
passwords are created; and 
[d] minimum password change of character requirements as defined are enforced when 
new passwords are created.

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals using passwords as 
individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords are used as 
part of multifactor authenticators. The number of changed characters refers to the number 
of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. 
To mitigate certain brute force attacks against passwords, organizations may also consider 
salting passwords. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Password complexity means using different types of characters as well as a specified number 
of characters. This applies to both the creation of new passwords and the modification of 
existing passwords. Characters to manage complexity include numbers, lowercase and 
uppercase letters, and symbols. Minimum complexity requirements are left up to the 
organization to define. Define the lowest level of password complexity required. Define the 
number of characters that must be changed when an existing password is changed. Enforce 
these rules for all passwords. Salting passwords adds a string of random characters (salt) to 
a password prior to hashing. This ensures the randomness of the resulting hash value. 
Example 
You work with management to define password complexity rules and ensure they are listed 
in the company’s security policy. You define and enforce a minimum number of characters 
for each password and ensure that a certain number of characters must be changed when 
updating passwords [a,b]. Characters include numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and 
symbols [a]. These rules help create hard-to-guess passwords, which help to secure your 
network. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is a degree of complexity specified for passwords, (e.g., are account passwords a 
minimum of 12 characters and a mix of upper/lower case, numbers, and special 
characters), including minimum requirements for each type [a,b,c]? 
 Is a change of characters required when new passwords are created [d]?

Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Individuals may not reuse their passwords for a defined period of time and a set number of 
passwords generated. 
Example 
You explain in your company’s security policy that changing passwords regularly provides 
increased security by reducing the ability of adversaries to exploit stolen or purchased 
passwords over an extended period. You define how often individuals can reuse their 
passwords and the minimum number of password generations before reuse [a]. If a user 
tries to reuse a password before the number of password generations has been exceeded, an 
error message is generated, and the user is required to enter a new password [b]. Potential Assessment Considerations

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing password-based authenticator

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Changing temporary passwords to permanent passwords immediately after system logon 
ensures that the necessary strength of the authentication mechanism is implemented at the 
earliest opportunity, reducing the susceptibility to authenticator compromises. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Users must change their temporary passwords the first time they log in. Temporary 
passwords often follow a consistent style within an organization and can be more easily 
guessed than passwords created by the unique user. This approach to temporary passwords 
should be avoided. 
Example 
One of your duties as a systems administrator is to create accounts for new users. You 
configure all systems with user accounts to require users to change a temporary password upon initial login to a permanent password [a]. When a user logs on for the first time, they 
are prompted to create a unique password that meets all of the defined complexity rules. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are temporary passwords only valid to allow a user to perform a password reset [a]? 
 Does the system enforce an immediate password change after logon when a temporary 
password is issued [a]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Cryptographically-protected passwords use salted one-way cryptographic hashes of 
passwords. 
See NIST Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
All passwords must be cryptographically protected using a one-way function for storage and 
transmission. This type of protection changes passwords into another form, or a hashed 
password. A one-way transformation makes it theoretically impossible to turn the hashed 
password back into the original password, but inadequate complexity (IA.L2-3.5.7) may still 
facilitate offline cracking of hashes. Example 
You are responsible for managing passwords for your organization. You protect all 
passwords with a one-way transformation, or hashing, before storing them. Passwords are 
never transmitted across a network unencrypted [a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are passwords prevented from being stored in reversible encryption form in any 
company systems [a]?43 
 Are passwords stored as one-way hashes constructed from passwords [a]?44

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing the obscuring of feedback of 
authentication information during authentication]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
The feedback from systems does not provide any information that would allow unauthorized 
individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of systems or system 
components, for example, desktop or notebook computers with relatively large monitors, 
the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of 
systems or components, for example, mobile devices with small displays, this threat may be 
less significant, and is balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors 
due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback 
is selected accordingly. Obscuring authenticator feedback includes displaying asterisks 
when users type passwords into input devices or displaying feedback for a very limited time 
before fully obscuring it. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Authentication information includes passwords. When users enter a password, the system 
displays a symbol, such as an asterisk, to obscure feedback preventing others from seeing 
the actual characters. Feedback is obscured based on a defined policy (e.g., smaller devices 
may briefly show characters before obscuring). Example 
As a system administrator, you configure your systems to display an asterisk when users 
enter their passwords into a computer system [a]. For mobile devices, the password 
characters are briefly displayed to the user before being obscured. This prevents people from 
figuring out passwords by looking over someone’s shoulder. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is the feedback immediately obscured when the authentication is presented on a larger 
display (e.g., desktop or notebook computers with relatively large monitors) [a]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Incident-handling capability for the organization; organizational processes 
for incident response assistance; mechanisms supporting or implementing incident 
response assistance]. DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations recognize that incident handling capability is dependent on the capabilities of 
organizational systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those 
systems. Organizations consider incident handling as part of the definition, design, and 
development of mission/business processes and systems. Incident-related information can 
be obtained from a variety of sources including audit monitoring, network monitoring, 
physical access monitoring, user and administrator reports, and reported supply chain 
events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many 
organizational entities including mission/business owners, system owners, authorizing 
officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, 
operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive. 
As part of user response activities, incident response training is provided by organizations 
and is linked directly to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel 
to ensure that the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For 
example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident 
on the system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle or 
remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on 
forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes 
user training in the identification/reporting of suspicious activities from external and 
internal sources. User response activities also includes incident response assistance which 
may consist of help desk support, assistance groups, and access to forensics services or 
consumer redress services, when required. 
NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling. SP 800-86 and SP 800-101 provide 
guidance on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. SP 800-161 provides 
guidance on supply chain risk management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Incident handling capabilities prepare your organization to respond to incidents and may:  
 identify people inside and outside your organization you may need to contact during an 
incident; 
 establish a way to report incidents, such as an email address or a phone number; 
 establish a system for tracking incidents; and 
 determine a place and a way to store evidence of an incident. 
Software and hardware may be required to analyze incidents when they occur. Incident 
prevention activities are also part of an incident-handling capability. The incident-handling 
team provides input for such things as risk assessments and training. 
Contractors detect incidents using different indicators. Indicators may include: 
 alerts from sensors or antivirus software; 
 a filename that looks unusual; and 
 log entries that raise concern. 
After detecting an incident, an incident response team performs analysis. This requires some 
knowledge of normal network operations. The incident should be documented including all 
the log entries associated with the incident. 
Containment of the incident is a critical step to stop the damage the incident is causing to 
your network. Containment activities should be based on previously defined organizational 
priorities and assessment of risk.  
Recovery activities restore systems to pre-incident functionality and address its underlying 
causes. Organizations should use recovery activities as a means of improving their overall 
resilience to future attacks. 
Example 
Your manager asks you to set up your company’s incident-response capability [a]. First, you 
create an email address to collect information on possible incidents. Next, you draft a contact 
list of all the people who need to know when an incident occurs. You document a procedure 
for how to submit incidents that includes roles and responsibilities when a potential incident 
is detected or reported. The procedure also explains how to track incidents, from initial 
creation to closure [b].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Tracking and documenting system security incidents includes maintaining records about 
each incident, the status of the incident, and other pertinent information necessary for 
forensics, evaluating incident details, trends, and handling. Incident information can be 
obtained from a variety of sources including incident reports, incident response teams, audit 
monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and user/administrator reports. Reporting incidents addresses specific incident reporting requirements within an 
organization and the formal incident reporting requirements for the organization. Suspected 
security incidents may also be reported and include the receipt of suspicious email 
communications that can potentially contain malicious code. The types of security incidents 
reported, the content and timeliness of the reports, and the designated reporting authorities 
reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, and policies. 
NIST SP 800-61 provides guidance on incident handling. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Incident handling is the actions the organization takes to prevent or contain the impact of an 
incident to the organization while it is occurring or shortly after it has occurred. The majority 
of the process consists of incident identification, containment, eradication, and recovery. 
During this process, it is essential to track the work processes required in order to effectively 
respond. Designate a central hub to serve as the point to coordinate, communicate, and track 
activities. The hub should receive and document information from system administrators, 
incident handlers, and others involved throughout the process. As the incident process 
moves toward eradication, executives, affected business units, and any required external 
stakeholders should be kept aware of the incident in order to make decisions affecting the 
business. Report to designated authorities, taking into account applicable laws, directives, 
regulations, and other guidance. Specify staff responsible for communicating about the 
incident to internal and external stakeholders. 
Example 
You notice unusual activity on a server and determine a potential security incident has 
occurred. You open a tracking ticket with the Security Operations Center (SOC), which 
assigns an incident handler to work the ticket [a]. The handler investigates and documents 
initial findings, which lead to a determination that unauthorized access occurred on the 
server [b]. The SOC establishes an incident management team consisting of security, 
database, network, and system administrators. The team meets daily to update progress and 
plan courses of action to contain the incident [a]. At the end of the day, the team provides a 
status report to IT executives [d,f]. Two days later, the team declares the incident contained. 
The team produces a final report as the database system is rebuilt and placed back into 
operation.

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms and processes for incident response]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the effectiveness of the 
capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing 
includes the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (both parallel 
and full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include 
a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission 
capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals due to incident response. 
NIST SP 800-84 provides guidance on testing programs for information technology 
capabilities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Testing incident response capability validates existing plans and highlights potential 
deficiencies. The test should address questions such as what happens during an incident; 
who is responsible for incident management; what tasks are assigned within the IT 
organization; what support is needed from legal, public affairs, or other business 
components; how resources are added if needed during the incident; and how law enforcement is involved. Any negative impacts to the normal day-to-day operations when 
responding to an incident should also be identified and documented. 
Example 
You decide to conduct an incident response table top exercise that simulates an attacker 
gaining access to the network through a compromised server. You include relevant IT staff 
such as security, database, network, and system administrators as participants. You also 
request representatives from legal, human resources, and communications. You provide a 
scenario to the group and have prepared key questions aligned with the response plans to 
guide the exercise. During the exercise, you focus on how the team executes the incident 
response plan. Afterward, you conduct a debrief with everyone that was involved to provide 
feedback and develop improvements to the incident response plan [a].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement addresses the information security aspects of the system maintenance 
program and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including 
hardware, firmware, applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal entity. System 
maintenance also includes those components not directly associated with information 
processing and data or information retention such as scanners, copiers, and printers. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
One common form of computer security maintenance is regular patching of discovered 
vulnerabilities in software and operating systems, though there are others that require 
attention.  
System maintenance includes: 
 corrective maintenance (e.g., repairing problems with the technology); 
 preventative maintenance (e.g., updates to prevent potential problems); 
 adaptive maintenance (e.g., changes to the operative environment); and 
 perfective maintenance (e.g., improve operations). 
Example 
You are responsible for maintenance activities on your company’s machines. This includes 
regular planned maintenance, unscheduled maintenance, reconfigurations when required, 
and damage repairs [a]. You know that failing to conduct maintenance activities can impact 
system security and availability, so you ensure that maintenance is regularly performed. You 
track all maintenance performed to assist with troubleshooting later if needed.

inspection of media used for maintenance]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement addresses security-related issues with maintenance tools that are not 
within the organizational system boundaries that process, store, or transmit CUI, but are 
used specifically for diagnostic and repair actions on those systems. Organizations have 
flexibility in determining the controls in place for maintenance tools, but can include 
approving, controlling, and monitoring the use of such tools. Maintenance tools are potential 
vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a 
facility and into organizational systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items, for example, hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and 
hardware and software packet sniffers. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Tools used to perform maintenance must remain secure so they do not introduce viruses or 
other malware into your system. Controlling your maintenance techniques prevents 
intentional or unintentional harm to your network and systems. Additionally, the personnel 
responsible for maintenance activities should be supervised considering their elevated 
privilege on company assets. 
Example 
You are responsible for maintenance activities on your company’s machines. To avoid 
introducing additional vulnerability into the systems you are maintaining, you make sure 
that all maintenance tools are approved and their usage is monitored and controlled [a,b]. 
You ensure the tools are kept current and up-to-date [a]. You and your backup are the only 
people authorized to use these tools and perform system maintenance [d].  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are physical or logical access controls used to limit access to maintenance tools to 
authorized personnel [a]? 
 Are physical or logical access controls used to limit access to system documentation and 
organizational maintenance process documentation to authorized personnel [b]? 
 Are physical or logical access controls used to limit access to automated mechanisms 
(e.g., automated scripts, scheduled jobs) to authorized personnel [c]? 
 Are physical or logical access controls used to limit access to the system entry points that 
enable maintenance (e.g., administrative portals, local and remote console access, and

MA.L2-3.7.3 – Equipment Sanitization,MA.L2-3.7.3 – EQUIPMENT SANITIZATION,Level 2 MA Practices,|Ensure equipment removed for off-site maintenance is sanitized of any CUI. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] equipment to be removed from organizational spaces for off-site maintenance is 
sanitized of any CUI. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System maintenance policy; procedures addressing controlled system 
maintenance; maintenance records; manufacturer or vendor maintenance specifications; 
equipment sanitization records; media sanitization records; system security plan; other 
relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system maintenance responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; personnel responsible for media sanitization; system

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for scheduling, performing, documenting, 
reviewing, approving, and monitoring maintenance and repairs for systems; organizational 
processes for sanitizing system components; mechanisms supporting or implementing 
controlled maintenance; mechanisms implementing sanitization of system components]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement addresses the information security aspects of system maintenance that are 
performed off-site and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component 
(including applications) conducted by a local or nonlocal entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, 
in-house, software maintenance agreement). 
NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Sanitization is a process that makes access to data infeasible on media such as a hard drive. 
The process may overwrite the entire media with a fixed pattern such as binary zeros. In 
addition to clearing the data an organization could purge (e.g., degaussing, secure erasing, or 
disassembling) the data, or even destroy the media (e.g., incinerating, shredding, or pulverizing). Performing one of these activities ensures that the data is extremely hard to 
recover, thus ensuring its confidentiality. 
For additional guidance on which specific sanitization actions should be taken on any specific 
type of media, review the description of the Purge actions given in NIST SP 800-88 
Revision 1 – Guidelines for Media Sanitization. 
Example 
You manage your organization’s IT equipment. A recent DoD project has been using a storage 
array to house CUI. Recently, the array has experienced disk issues. After troubleshooting 
with the vendor, they recommend several drives be replaced in the array. Knowing the drives 
may contain CUI, you reference NIST 800-88 Rev. 1 and determine a strategy you can 
implement on the defective equipment – processing the drives with a degaussing unit [a]. 
Once all the drives have been wiped, you document the action and ship the faulty drives to 
the vendor. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is there a process for sanitizing (e.g., erasing, wiping, degaussing) equipment that was 
used to store, process, or transmit CUI before it is removed from the facility for off-site 
maintenance (e.g., manufacturer or contracted maintenance support) [a]?

are used in organizational systems. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] media containing diagnostic and test programs are checked for malicious code before 
being used in organizational systems that process, store, or transmit CUI. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System maintenance policy; procedures addressing system maintenance 
tools; system maintenance tools and associated documentation; maintenance records;

Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system maintenance responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational process for inspecting media for malicious code; 
mechanisms supporting or implementing inspection of media used for maintenance]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
If, upon inspection of media containing maintenance diagnostic and test programs, 
organizations determine that the media contain malicious code, the incident is handled 
consistent with incident handling policies and procedures. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
As part of troubleshooting, a vendor may provide a diagnostic application to install on a 
system. As this is executable code, there is a chance that the file is corrupt or infected with 
malicious code. Implement procedures to scan any files prior to installation. The same level 
of scrutiny must be made as with any file a staff member may download. 
This practice, MA.L2-3.7.4, extends both SI.L1-3.14.2 and SI.L1-3.14.4. SI.L1-3.14.2 and SI.L1-
3.14.4 require the implementation and updating of mechanisms to protect systems from 
malicious code, and MA.L2-3.7.4 extends this requirement to diagnostic and testing tools. Example 
You have recently been experiencing performance issues on one of your servers. After 
troubleshooting for much of the morning, the vendor has asked to install a utility that will 
collect more data from the server. The file is stored on the vendor’s FTP server. The support 
technician gives you the FTP site so you can anonymously download the utility file. You also 
ask him for a hash of the utility file. As you download the file to your local computer, you 
realize it is compressed. You unzip the file and perform a manual antivirus scan, which 
reports no issues [a]. To verify the utility file has not been altered, you run an application to 
see that the hash from the vendor matches. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are media containing diagnostic and test programs (e.g., downloaded or copied utilities 
or tools from manufacturer, third-party, or in-house support teams) checked for 
malicious code (e.g., using antivirus or antimalware scans) before the media are used on 
organizational systems [a]?

MA.L2-3.7.5 – Nonlocal Maintenance,MA.L2-3.7.5 – NONLOCAL MAINTENANCE,Level 2 MA Practices,|Require multifactor authentication to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via external 
network connections and terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is 
complete. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] multifactor authentication is used to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via 
external network connections; and 
[b] nonlocal maintenance sessions established via external network connections are 
terminated when nonlocal maintenance is complete. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System maintenance policy; procedures addressing nonlocal system 
maintenance; system security plan; system design documentation; system configuration

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing nonlocal maintenance; mechanisms 
implementing, supporting, and managing nonlocal maintenance; mechanisms for strong 
authentication of nonlocal maintenance diagnostic sessions; mechanisms for terminating 
nonlocal maintenance sessions and network connections]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals 
communicating through an external network. The authentication techniques employed in 
the establishment of these nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network 
access requirements in IA.L2-3.5.3. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Nonlocal maintenance activities must use multifactor authentication. Multifactor 
authentication requires at least two factors, such as:  something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); 
 something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or 
 something you are (e.g., biometric fingerprint or facial scan). 
Requiring two or more factors to prove your identity increases the security of the 
connection. Nonlocal maintenance activities are activities conducted from external network 
connections such as over the internet. After nonlocal maintenance activities are complete, 
shut down the external network connection. 
This practice, MA.L2-3.7.5 requires the addition of multifactor authentication for remote 
maintenance sessions and complements five other practices dealing with remote access 
(AC.L2-3.1.12, AC.L2-3.1.14, AC.L2-3.1.13, AC.L2-3.1.15, and IA.L2-3.5.3):  
 AC.L2-3.1.12 requires the control of remote access sessions.  
 AC.L2-3.1.14 limits remote access to specific access control points.  
 AC.L2-3.1.13 requires the use of cryptographic mechanisms when enabling remote 
sessions.  
 AC.L2-3.1.15 requires authorization for privileged commands executed during a remote 
session.  
 Finally, IA.L2-3.5.3 requires multifactor authentication for network access to non-
privileged accounts. 
Example 
You are responsible for maintaining your company’s firewall. In order to conduct 
maintenance while working remotely, you connect to the firewall’s management interface 
and log in using administrator credentials. The firewall then sends a verification request to 
the multifactor authentication app on your smartphone [a]. You need both of these things to 
prove your identity [a]. After you respond to the multifactor challenge, you have access to 
the maintenance interface. When you finish your activities, you shut down the remote 
connection by logging out and quitting your web browser [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is multifactor authentication required prior to maintenance of a system when connecting 
remotely from outside the system boundary [a]? 
 Are personnel required to manually terminate remote maintenance sessions established 
via external network connections when maintenance is complete, or are connections 
terminated automatically through system session management mechanisms [b]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for authorizing and managing maintenance 
personnel; mechanisms supporting or implementing authorization of maintenance

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to individuals who are performing hardware or software 
maintenance on organizational systems, while PE.L1-3.10.1 addresses physical access for 
individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter 
of the systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant maintenance personnel). Individuals not 
previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology 
manufacturers, vendors, consultants, and systems integrators, may require privileged access 
to organizational systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities 
with little or no notice. Organizations may choose to issue temporary credentials to these 
individuals based on organizational risk assessments. Temporary credentials may be for 
one-time use or for very limited time periods. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Individuals without proper permissions must be supervised while conducting maintenance 
on organizational machines. Consider creating temporary accounts with short-term 
expiration periods rather than regular user accounts. Additionally, limit the permissions and 
access these accounts have to the most restrictive settings possible.  
Example 
One of your software providers has to come on-site to update the software on your 
company’s computers. You give the individual a temporary logon and password that expires 
in 12 hours and is limited to accessing only the computers necessary to complete the work 
[a]. This gives the technician access long enough to perform the update. You monitor the 
individual’s physical and network activity while the maintenance is taking place [a] and 
revoke access when the job is done. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are there processes for escorting and supervising maintenance personnel without 
required access authorization (e.g., vendor support personnel, short-term maintenance 
contractors) during system maintenance [a]?

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with media sanitization responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media sanitization; mechanisms supporting or 
implementing media sanitization]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or 
reuse. Examples include: digital media found in workstations, network components, 
scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media 
such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media 
such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, 
including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of 
information to unauthorized individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction 
may be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization. 
Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures 
for media containing information that is in the public domain or publicly releasable or 
deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or 
disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing FCI from 
documents, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the 
redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing the words 
or sections from the document. NARA policy and guidance control sanitization processes for 
federal contract information. NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
“Media” refers to a broad range of items that store information, including paper documents, 
disks, tapes, digital photography, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones. It is important 
to know what information is on media so that you can handle it properly. If there is FCI, you 
or someone in your company should either: 
 shred or destroy the device before disposal so it cannot be read; or  
 clean or purge the information, if you want to reuse the device. 
See NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, for more 
information. 
Example 
As you pack for an office move, you find some old CDs in a file cabinet. You determine that 
one has information about an old project your company did for the DoD. You shred the CD 
rather than simply throwing it in the trash [a].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
System media includes digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes diskettes, 
magnetic tapes, external and removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and 
digital video disks. Non-digital media includes paper and microfilm. Protecting digital media 
includes limiting access to design specifications stored on compact disks or flash drives in 
the media library to the project leader and any individuals on the development team. 
Physically controlling system media includes conducting inventories, maintaining 
accountability for stored media, and ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to 
check out and return media to the media library. Secure storage includes a locked drawer, 
desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library. Access to CUI on system media can be limited by physically controlling such media, which 
includes conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to 
check out and return media to the media library, and maintaining accountability for all 
stored media. 
NIST SP 800-111 provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
CUI can be contained on two types of physical media: 
 hardcopy (e.g., CD drives, USB drives, magnetic tape); and 
 digital devices (e.g., CD drives, USB drives, video). 
You should store physical media containing CUI in a secure location. This location should be 
accessible only to those people with the proper permissions. All who access CUI should 
follow the process for checking it out and returning it. 
Example 
Your company has CUI for a specific Army contract contained on a USB drive. You store the 
drive in a locked drawer, and you log it on an inventory [d]. You establish a procedure to 
check out the USB drive so you have a history of who is accessing it. These procedures help 
to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is hardcopy media containing CUI handled only by authorized personnel according to 
defined procedures [a]? 
 Is digital media containing CUI handled only by authorized personnel according to 
defined procedures [b]? 
 Is paper media containing CUI physically secured (e.g., in a locked drawer or cabinet) [c]?

FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Limit physical access to CUI to people permitted to access CUI. Use locked or controlled 
storage areas and limit access to only those allowed to access CUI. Keep track of who accesses 
physical CUI in an audit log. 
Example 
Your company has CUI for a specific Army contract contained on a USB drive. In order to 
control the data, you establish specific procedures for handling the drive. You designate the 
project manager as the owner of the data and require anyone who needs access to the data 
to get permission from the data owner [a]. The data owner maintains a list of users that are authorized to access the information. Before an authorized individual can get access to the 
USB drive that contains the CUI they have to fill out a log and check out the drive. When they 
are done with the data, they check in the drive and return it to its secure storage location.

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural 
controls to meet the requirements established for protecting systems and information. 
Controls to maintain accountability for media during transport include locked containers 
and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity 
protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport 
include the actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport 
and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual 
transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals external to 
the organization. Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes restricting 
transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and obtaining explicit records of 
transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and 
detect loss, destruction, or tampering. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
CUI is protected in both physical and digital formats. Physical control can be accomplished 
using traditional concepts like restricted access to physical locations or locking papers in a 
desk or filing cabinet. The digitization of data makes access to CUI much easier. CUI can be 
stored and transported on magnetic disks, tapes, USB drives, CD-ROMs, and so on. This 
makes digital CUI data very portable. It is important for an organization to apply mechanisms 
to prevent unauthorized access to CUI due to ease of transport. 
Example 
Your team has recently completed configuring a server for a DoD customer. The customer 
has asked that it be ready to plug in and use. An application installed on the server contains 
data that is considered CUI. You box the server for shipment using tamper-evident packaging 
and label it with the specific recipient for the shipment [b]. You select a reputable shipping 
service so you will get a tracking number to monitor the progress. Once the item is shipped, 
you send the recipients the tracking number so they can monitor and ensure prompt delivery 
at their facility. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do only approved individuals have access to media containing CUI [a]?  
 Is access to the media containing CUI recorded in an audit log [b]? 
 Is all CUI data on media encrypted or physically locked prior to transport outside of 
secure locations [b]?49

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to portable storage devices (e.g., USB memory sticks, digital video 
disks, compact disks, external or removable hard disk drives). 
NIST SP 800-111 provides guidance on storage encryption technologies for end user devices. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
CUI can be stored and transported on a variety of portable media, which increases the chance 
that the CUI can be lost. When identifying the paths CUI flows through your company, identify 
devices to include in this practice. 
To mitigate the risk of losing or exposing CUI, implement an encryption scheme to protect 
the data. Even if the media are lost, proper encryption renders the data inaccessible. When 
encryption is not an option, apply alternative physical safeguards during transport. This practice, MP.L2-3.8.6, provides additional protections to those provided by MP.L2-3.8.5. 
This practice is intended to protect against situations where control of media access fails, 
such as through the loss of the media. 
Example 
You manage the backups for file servers in your datacenter. You know that in addition to the 
company’s sensitive information, CUI is stored on the file servers. As part of a broader plan 
to protect data, you send the backup tapes off site to a vendor. You are aware that your 
backup software provides the option to encrypt data onto tape. You develop a plan to test 
and enable backup encryption for the data sent off site. This encryption provides additional 
protections for the data on the backup tapes during transport and offsite storage [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are all CUI data on media encrypted or physically protected prior to transport outside of

MP.L2-3.8.7 – Removeable Media,MP.L2-3.8.7 – REMOVEABLE MEDIA,Level 2 MP Practices,|Control the use of removable media on system components. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] the use of removable media on system components is controlled. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; system use policy; procedures addressing 
media usage restrictions; system security plan; rules of behavior; system design 
documentation; system configuration settings and associated documentation; system audit

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system media use responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media use; mechanisms restricting or 
prohibiting use of system media on systems or system components]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
In contrast to requirement MP.L2-3.8.1, which restricts user access to media, this 
requirement restricts the use of certain types of media on systems, for example, restricting 
or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ 
technical and nontechnical controls (e.g., policies, procedures, and rules of behavior) to 
control the use of system media. Organizations may control the use of portable storage 
devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain 
external ports, or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to such devices. 
Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices 
including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved 
organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may control 
the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, prohibiting the use of 
writeable, portable devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the 
capability to write to such devices. Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus 
signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. Many technologies and methods 
exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management 
and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of 
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other 
types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. 
Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these 
situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, 
configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring 
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions 
intended. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Removable media are any type of media storage that you can remove from your computer 
or machine (e.g., CDs, DVDs, diskettes, and USB drives). Write a specific policy for removable 
media. The policy should cover the various types of removable media (e.g., write-once media 
and rewritable media) and should discuss the company’s approach to removable media. 
Ensure the following controls are considered and included in the policy: 
 limit the use of removable media to the smallest number needed; and 
 scan all removable media for viruses. 
Example 
You are in charge of IT operations. You establish a policy for removable media that includes 
USB drives [a]. The policy information such as: 
 only USB drives issued by the organization may be used; and 
 USB drives are to be used for work purposes only [a].  
You set up a separate computer to scan these drives before anyone uses them on the 
network. This computer has anti-virus software installed that is kept up to date. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are removable media allowed [a]?50 
 Are policies and/or procedures in use to control the use of removable media [a]?

MP.L2-3.8.8 – Shared Media,MP.L2-3.8.8 – SHARED MEDIA,Level 2 MP Practices,|Prohibit the use of portable storage devices when such devices have no identifiable owner. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] the use of portable storage devices is prohibited when such devices have no identifiable 
owner. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System media protection policy; system use policy; procedures addressing 
media usage restrictions; system security plan; rules of behavior; system configuration 
settings and associated documentation; system design documentation; system audit logs and

Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system media use responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities; system or network administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for media use; mechanisms prohibiting use of 
media on systems or system components]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Requiring identifiable owners (e.g., individuals, organizations, or projects) for portable 
storage devices reduces the overall risk of using such technologies by allowing organizations 
to assign responsibility and accountability for addressing known vulnerabilities in the 
devices (e.g., insertion of malicious code). 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A portable storage device is a system component that can be inserted into and removed from 
a system and is used to store data or information. It typically plugs into a laptop or desktop 
port (e.g., USB port). These devices can contain malicious files that can lead to a compromise 
of a connected system. Therefore, use should be prohibited if the device cannot be traced to 
an owner who is responsible and accountable for its security. 
This practice, MP.L2-3.8.8, furthers the protections provided by MP.L2-3.8.7 by prohibiting 
unidentified media use even if that media type is allowable. 
 Example 
You are the IT manager. One day, a staff member reports finding a USB drive in the parking 
lot. You investigate and learn that there are no labels on the outside of the drive to indicate 
who might be responsible for it. You send an email to all employees to remind them that IT 
policies expressly prohibit plugging unknown devices into company computers. You also 
direct staff members to turn in to the IT help desk any devices that have no identifiable 
owner [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do portable storage devices used have identifiable owners [a]?

MP.L2-3.8.9 – Protect Backups,MP.L2-3.8.9 – PROTECT BACKUPS,Level 2 MP Practices,|Protect the confidentiality of backup CUI at storage locations. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] the confidentiality of backup CUI is protected at storage locations. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Procedures addressing system backup; system configuration settings and

Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with system backup responsibilities; personnel with information 
security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for conducting system backups; mechanisms 
supporting or implementing system backups]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations can employ cryptographic mechanisms or alternative physical controls to 
protect the confidentiality of backup information at designated storage locations. Backed-up 
information containing CUI may include system-level information and user-level 
information. System-level information includes system-state information, operating system 
software, application software, and licenses. User-level information includes information 
other than system-level information. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
You protect CUI to ensure that it remains private (confidentiality) and unchanged (integrity). 
Methods to ensure confidentiality may include: 
 encrypting files or media; 
 managing who has access to the information; and 
 physically securing devices and media that contain CUI. 
Storage locations for information are varied, and may include: 
 external hard drives;  USB drives; 
 magnetic media (tape cartridge); 
 optical disk (CD, DVD); 
 Networked Attached Storage (NAS); 
 servers; and 
 cloud backup. 
This practice, MP.L2-3.8.9, requires the confidentiality of backup information at storage 
locations. 
Example 
You are in charge of protecting CUI for your company. Because the company’s backups 
contain CUI, you work with IT to protect the confidentiality of backup data. You agree to 
encrypt all CUI data as it is saved to an external hard drive [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are data backups encrypted on media before removal from a secured facility [a]?  
 Are cryptographic mechanisms FIPS validated [a]?51

PS.L2-3.9.1 – Screen Individuals,Personnel Security (PS),Level 2 PS Practices,|Screen individuals prior to authorizing access to organizational systems containing CUI. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] individuals are screened prior to authorizing access to organizational systems 
containing CUI. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing personnel screening; 
records of screened personnel; system security plan; other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with personnel security responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel screening]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Personnel security screening (vetting) activities involve the evaluation/assessment of 
individual’s conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability (i.e., the 
trustworthiness of the individual) prior to authorizing access to organizational systems 
containing CUI. The screening activities reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, 
directives, policies, regulations, and specific criteria established for the level of access 
required for assigned positions. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Ensure all employees who need access to CUI undergo organization-defined screening before 
being granted access. Base the types of screening on the requirements for a given position 
and role. The effective screening of personnel provided by this practice, PS.L2-3.9.1, improves upon 
the effectiveness of authentication performed in IA.L1-3.5.2. 
Example 
You are in charge of security at your organization. You complete standard criminal 
background and credit checks of all individuals you hire before they can access CUI [a]. Your 
screening program follows appropriate laws, policies, regulations, and criteria for the level 
of access required for each position. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are appropriate background checks completed prior granting access to organizational 
systems containing CUI [a]?

PS.L2-3.9.2 – Personnel Actions,PS.L2-3.9.2 – PERSONNEL ACTIONS,Level 2 PS Practices,|Ensure that organizational systems containing CUI are protected during and after personnel 
actions such as terminations and transfers. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] a policy and/or process for terminating system access and any credentials coincident 
with personnel actions is established; 
[b] system access and credentials are terminated consistent with personnel actions such as 
termination or transfer; and 
[c] the system is protected during and after personnel transfer actions. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel security policy; procedures addressing personnel transfer and 
termination; records of personnel transfer and termination actions; list of system accounts; 
records of terminated or revoked authenticators and credentials; records of exit interviews; 
other relevant documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: Personnel with personnel security responsibilities; personnel with account 
management responsibilities; system or network administrators; personnel with 
information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for personnel transfer and termination; 
mechanisms supporting or implementing personnel transfer and termination notifications; 
mechanisms for disabling system access and revoking authenticators]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Protecting CUI during and after personnel actions may include returning system-related 
property and conducting exit interviews. System-related property includes hardware 
authentication tokens, identification cards, system administration technical manuals, keys, 
and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that individuals who have been terminated 
understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper 
accountability is achieved for system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit 
interviews can include reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and 
potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some 
terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and non-availability of supervisors. For termination actions, timely execution is essential for 
individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the 
system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being 
notified. 
This requirement applies to reassignments or transfers of individuals when the personnel 
action is permanent or of such extended durations as to require protection. Organizations 
define the CUI protections appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether 
permanent or extended. Protections that may be required for transfers or reassignments to 
other positions within organizations include returning old and issuing new keys, 
identification cards, and building passes; changing system access authorizations (i.e., 
privileges); closing system accounts and establishing new accounts; and providing for access 
to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in previous 
system accounts. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Employee access to CUI is removed when they change jobs or leave the company. When 
employment or program access is terminated for any reason, the following actions may occur 
within the defined time frame: 
 all company IT equipment (e.g., laptops, cell phones, storage devices) is returned; 
 all identification, access cards, and keys are returned; and 
 an exit interview is conducted to remind the employee of their obligations to not discuss 
CUI, even after employment.  
Additionally, perform the following: 
 remove access to all accounts granting access to CUI or modify access to CUI as 
appropriate for a new work role; 
 disable or close employee accounts for departing employees; and 
 limit access to physical spaces with CUI for departing employees or those who transition 
to a work role that does not require access to CUI. 
This practice, PS.L2-3.9.2, leverages the identification of system users required by IA.L1-
3.5.1 in order to ensure that all accesses are identified and removed. 
Example 1 
You are in charge of IT operations. Per organizational policies, when workers leave the 
company, you remove them from any physical CUI access lists. If you are not their supervisor, 
you contact their supervisor or human resources immediately and ask them to: 
 turn in the former employees’ computers for proper handling; 
 inform help desk or system administrators to have the former employees’ system access 
revoked; 
 retrieve the former employees’ identification and access cards; and 
 have the former employees attend an exit interview where you or human resources 
remind them of their obligations to not discuss CUI [b]. 
Example 2 
An employee transfers from one working group in your company to another. Human 
resources team notifies IT of the transfer date, and the employee’s new manager follows 
procedure by submitting a ticket to the IT help desk to provide information on the access 
rights the employee will require in their new role. IT implements the rights for the new 
position and revokes the access for the prior position on the official date of the transfer [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is information system access disabled upon employee termination or transfer [c]? 
 Are authenticators/ credentials associated with the employee revoked upon termination 
or transfer within a certain time frame [b,c]? 
 Is all company information system-related property retrieved from the terminated or 
transferred employee within a certain timeframe [a,c]? 
 Is access to company information and information systems formerly controlled by the 
terminated or transferred employee retained for a certain timeframe [a,c]? 
 Is the information security office and data owner of the change in authorization notified 
within a certain timeframe [a]?52

[a] authorized individuals allowed physical access are identified; 
[b] physical access to organizational systems is limited to authorized individuals; 
[c] physical access to equipment is limited to authorized individuals; and

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access authorizations; mechanisms

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to employees, individuals with permanent physical access 
authorization credentials, and visitors. Authorized individuals have credentials that include 
badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of 
authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies, 
regulations, standards, procedures, and guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas 
within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible. Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or 
other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing 
equipment in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing 
devices, external disk drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, 
facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of equipment. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
This addresses the company’s physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment 
rooms), technical assets, and non-technical assets that need to be protected from 
unauthorized physical access. Specific environments are limited to authorized employees, 
and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc. 
Output devices, such as printers, are placed in areas where their use does not expose data to 
unauthorized individuals. Lists of personnel with authorized access are developed and 
maintained, and personnel are issued appropriate authorization credentials. 
Example 
You manage a DoD project that requires special equipment used only by project team 
members [b,c]. You work with the facilities manager to put locks on the doors to the areas 
where the equipment is stored and used [b,c,d]. Project team members are the only 
individuals issued with keys to the space. This restricts access to only those employees who 
work on the DoD project and require access to that equipment. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are lists of personnel with authorized access developed and maintained, and are 
appropriate authorization credentials issued [a]?53  
 Has the facility/building manager designated building areas as “sensitive” and designed 
physical security protections (e.g., guards, locks, cameras, card readers) to limit physical 
access to the area to only authorized employees [b,c,d]?54 
 Are output devices such as printers placed in areas where their use does not expose data 
to unauthorized individuals [c]?55

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Individuals with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered 
visitors. Audit logs can be used to monitor visitor activity. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Do not allow visitors, even those people you know well, to walk around your facility without 
an escort. Make sure that all non-employees wear special visitor badges and/or are escorted 
by an employee at all times while on the property. 
Example 
Coming back from a meeting, you see the friend of a coworker walking down the hallway 
near your office. You know this person well and trust them, but are not sure why they are in 
the building. You stop to talk, and the person explains that they are meeting a coworker for lunch, but cannot remember where the lunchroom is. You walk the person back to the 
reception area to get a visitor badge and wait until someone can escort them to the lunch 
room [a]. You report this incident and the company decides to install a badge reader at the 
main door so visitors cannot enter without an escort [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are personnel required to accompany visitors to areas in a facility with physical access 
to organizational systems [a]? 
 Are visitors clearly distinguishable from regular personnel [b]? 
 Is visitor activity monitored (e.g., use of cameras or guards, reviews of secure areas upon 
visitor departure, review of visitor audit logs) [b]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for physical access control; mechanisms

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be 
procedural (e.g., written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing 
ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include 
facility access points, interior access points to systems or system components requiring 
supplemental access controls, or both. System components (e.g., workstations, notebook 
computers) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations 
safeguarding access to such devices. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can 
do this in writing by having employees and visitors sign in and sign out or by electronic 
means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records 
for the time period that your company has defined. Example 
You and your coworkers like to have friends and family join you for lunch at the office on 
Fridays. Your small company has just signed a contract with the DoD, however, and you now 
need to document who enters and leaves your facility. You work with the reception staff to 
ensure that all non-employees sign in at the reception area and sign out when they leave [a]. 
You retain those paper sign-in sheets in a locked filing cabinet for one year. Employees 
receive badges or key cards that enable tracking and logging access to company facilities.

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Identifying and controlling physical access devices (e.g., locks, badges, key cards) is just as 
important as monitoring and limiting who is able to physically access certain equipment. 
Physical access devices are only strong protection if you know who has them and what access 
they allow. Physical access devices can be managed using manual or automatic processes 
such a list of who is assigned what key, or updating the badge access system as personnel 
change roles. Example 
You are a facility manager. A team member retired today and returns their company keys to 
you. The project on which they were working requires access to areas that contain 
equipment with FCI. You receive the keys, check your electronic records against the serial 
numbers on the keys to ensure all have been returned, and mark each key returned [c].  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are lists or inventories of physical access devices maintained (e.g., keys, facility badges, 
key cards) [a]? 
 Is access to physical access devices limited (e.g., granted to, and accessible only by,

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Monitoring of physical access includes publicly accessible areas within organizational 
facilities. This can be accomplished, for example, by the employment of guards; the use of 
sensor devices; or the use of video surveillance equipment such as cameras. Examples of 
support infrastructure include system distribution, transmission, and power lines. Security 
controls applied to the support infrastructure prevent accidental damage, disruption, and 
physical tampering. Such controls may also be necessary to prevent eavesdropping or 
modification of unencrypted transmissions. Physical access controls to support infrastructure include locked wiring closets; disconnected or locked spare jacks; protection 
of cabling by conduit or cable trays; and wiretapping sensors. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The infrastructure inside of a facility, such as power and network cables, is protected so that 
visitors and unauthorized employees cannot access it. The protection is also monitored by 
security guards, video cameras, sensors, or alarms. 
Example 
You are responsible for protecting your IT facilities. You install video cameras at each 
entrance and exit, connect them to a video recorder, and show the camera feeds on a display 
at the reception desk [c,d]. You also make sure there are secure locks on all entrances, exits, 
and windows to the facilities [a,b].

PE.L2-3.10.6 – Alternative Work Sites,PE.L2-3.10.6 – ALTERNATIVE WORK SITES,Level 2 PE Practices,|Enforce safeguarding measures for CUI at alternate work sites. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] safeguarding measures for CUI are defined for alternate work sites; and 
[b] safeguarding measures for CUI are enforced for alternate work sites. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Physical and environmental protection policy; procedures addressing 
alternate work sites for personnel; system security plan; list of safeguards required for 
alternate work sites; assessments of safeguards at alternate work sites; other relevant 
documents or records].

security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for security at alternate work sites; mechanisms 
supporting alternate work sites; safeguards employed at alternate work sites; means of 
communications between personnel at alternate work sites and security personnel]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Alternate work sites may include government facilities or the private residences of 
employees. Organizations may define different security requirements for specific alternate 
work sites or types of sites depending on the work-related activities conducted at those sites. 
NIST SP 800-46 and NIST SP 800-114 provide guidance on enterprise and user security 
when teleworking. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Many people work from home or travel as part of their job. Define and implement safeguards 
to account for protection of information beyond the enterprise perimeter. Safeguards may 
include physical protections, such as locked file drawers, as well as electronic protections 
such as encryption, audit logging, and proper access controls. Example 
Many of your company’s project managers work remotely as they often travel to sponsor 
locations or even work from home. Because the projects on which they work require access 
to CUI, you must ensure the same level of protection is afforded as when they work in the 
office. You ensure that each laptop is deployed with patch management and anti-virus 
software protection [b]. Because data may be stored on the local hard drive, you have 
enabled full-disk encryption on their laptops [b]. When a remote staff member needs access 
to the internal network you require VPN connectivity that also disconnects the laptop from 
the remote network (i.e., prevents split tunneling) [b]. The VPN requires multifactor 
authentication to verify remote users are who they claim to be [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do all alternate sites where CUI data is stored or processed meet the same physical 
security requirements as the main site [b]?59 
 Does the alternate processing site provide information security measures equivalent to 
those of the primary site [b]?60

RA.L2-3.11.1 – RIsk Assessments,Risk Assessment (RA),Level 2 RA Practices,|Periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, 
or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, resulting from the operation of 
organizational systems and the associated processing, storage, or transmission of CUI. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] the frequency to assess risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, and 
individuals is defined; and 
[b] risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals resulting from 
the operation of an organizational system that processes, stores, or transmits CUI is 
assessed with the defined frequency. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: Risk assessment policy; security planning policy and procedures; 
procedures addressing organizational risk assessments; system security plan; risk 
assessment; risk assessment results; risk assessment reviews; risk assessment updates;

[SELECT FROM: Personnel with risk assessment responsibilities; personnel with 
information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for risk assessment; mechanisms supporting or 
for conducting, documenting, reviewing, disseminating, and updating the risk assessment]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Clearly defined system boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Such risk 
assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational 
operations, organizational assets, and individuals based on the operation and use of 
organizational systems. Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., 
service providers, contractor operating systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational systems, outsourcing entities). Risk assessments, either formal or 
informal, can be conducted at the organization level, the mission or business process level, 
or the system level, and at any phase in the system development life cycle. 
NIST SP 800-30 provides guidance on conducting risk assessments. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Risk arises from anything that can reduce an organization’s assurance of mission/business 
success; cause harm to image or reputation; or harm individuals, other organizations, or the 
Nation. 
Organizations assess the risk to their operations and assets at regular intervals. Areas where 
weakness or vulnerabilities could lead to risk may include: 
 poorly designed and executed business processes; 
 inadvertent actions of people, such as disclosure or modification of information; 
 intentional actions of people inside and outside the organization; 
 failure of systems to perform as intended; 
 failures of technology; and 
 external events, such as natural disasters, public infrastructure and supply chain failures. 
When conducting risk assessments use established criteria and procedures. The results of 
formal risk assessments are documented. It is important to note that risk assessments differ 
from vulnerability assessments (see RA.L2-3.11.2). A vulnerability assessment provides 
input to a risk assessment along with other information such as results from likelihood 
analysis and analysis of potential treat sources. 
Risk assessments should be performed at defined regular intervals. Mission risks include 
anything that will keep an organization from meeting its mission. Function risk is anything 
that will prevent the performance of a function. Image and reputation risks refer to 
intangible risks that have value and could cause damage to potential or future trust 
relationships.61 
This practice, RA.L2-3.11.1, which requires periodically assessing the risk to organization 
systems, assets, and individuals, is a baseline Risk Assessment practice. RA.L2-3.11.1 enables 
other Risk Assessment practices (e.g., RA.L2-3.11.3, Vulnerability Remediation), as well as 
CA.L2-3.12.2, Plan of Action. 
Example 
You are a system administrator. You and your team members are working on a big 
government contract requiring you to store CUI. As part of your periodic (e.g., annual) risk 
assessment exercise, you evaluate the new risk involved with storing CUI [a,b]. When 
conducting the assessment you consider increased legal exposure, financial requirements of 
safeguarding CUI, potentially elevated attention from external attackers, and other factors. 
                                                          
 
61 NIST SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments, September 2012. 
After determining how storing CUI affects your overall risk profile, you use that as a basis for 
a conversation on how that risk should be mitigated. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Have initial and periodic risk assessments been conducted [b]?62  
 Are methods defined for assessing risk (e.g., reviewing security assessments, incident 
reports, and security advisories, identifying threat sources, threat events, and 
vulnerabilities, and determining likelihood, impact, and overall risk to the confidentiality 
of CUI) [b]?

administrators]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning, analysis, remediation, 
and information sharing; mechanisms supporting or implementing vulnerability scanning, 
analysis, remediation, and information sharing]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all system components, 
ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and 
copiers are not overlooked. The vulnerabilities to be scanned are readily updated as new vulnerabilities are discovered, announced, and scanning methods developed. This process 
ensures that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly 
as possible. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional 
approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three 
approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in source code reviews and 
in a variety of tools (e.g., static analysis tools, web-based application scanners, binary 
analyzers). Vulnerability scanning includes: scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, 
ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning 
for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. 
To facilitate interoperability, organizations consider using products that are Security 
Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated, scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in 
the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention, and that employ the 
Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of system 
vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness 
Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). 
Security assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential 
vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that 
express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). In certain 
situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive or the system 
component that is the subject of the scanning may contain highly sensitive information. 
Privileged access authorization to selected system components facilitates thorough 
vulnerability scanning and protects the sensitive nature of such scanning. 
NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on vulnerability management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A vulnerability scanner is an application that identifies vulnerabilities in organizational 
assets. Most scanners can create a prioritized list of vulnerabilities ordered by their level of 
severity. Scan for vulnerabilities on all devices connected to the network including servers, 
desktops, laptops, virtual machines, containers, firewalls, switches, and printers. All assets 
that are within the scope of the CMMC assessment must be scanned, including assets such as 
laptop computers that may not routinely connect to an organization’s network. 
Perform reviews of your organization’s custom-developed software. Vulnerability analysis 
of a custom-made solution may require a penetration tester to properly test and validate 
findings. Automated vulnerability scanners may not be as thorough when scanning custom 
developed applications. Source code scanners can help identify weaknesses and 
vulnerabilities within code prior to compilation and use. 
The vulnerability scanning process is a regular activity, not a single occurrence. 
Organizations put in place a vulnerability scanner that updates its database each time it 
performs a scan so it can identify the most current known vulnerabilities. Schedule scans 
with consideration of the potential for impact to normal operations and use caution when 
scanning critical assets. 
This practice, RA.L2-3.11.2, which ensures scanning for vulnerabilities in organizational 
systems and application, is a baseline Risk Assessment practice. RA.L2-3.11.2 ,contributes 
to performing risk assessments as described in RA.L2-3.11.1. 
Example 
You are a system administrator. Your organization has assessed its risk and determined that 
it needs to scan for vulnerabilities in systems and applications once each quarter [a]. You 
conduct some tests and decide that it is important to be able to schedule scans after standard 
business hours. You also realize that you have remote workers and that you will need to be 
sure to scan their remote computers as well [b]. After some final tests, you integrate the scans 
into normal IT operations, running as scheduled [b,c]. You verify that the scanner application 
receives the latest updates on vulnerabilities and that those are included in future scans [d,e]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is the frequency specified for vulnerability scans to be performed in organizational 
systems and applications (e.g., continuous passive scanning, scheduled active scans) [a]? 
 Are vulnerability scans performed on a defined frequency or randomly in accordance 
with company policy [a,b,c]?63 
 Are systems periodically scanned for common and new vulnerabilities [d,e]?64 
 Is the list of scanned system vulnerabilities updated on a defined frequency or when new 
vulnerabilities are identified and reported [d,e]?65

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for vulnerability scanning, analysis, remediation,

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Vulnerabilities discovered, for example, via the scanning conducted in response to RA.L2-
3.11.2, are remediated with consideration of the related assessment of risk. The 
consideration of risk influences the prioritization of remediation efforts and the level of 
effort to be expended in the remediation for specific vulnerabilities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Not all vulnerabilities captured in a vulnerability scanner may pose the same level of risk to 
an organization. Prioritize mitigation efforts to close the most critical vulnerabilities first. 
Track all vulnerability remediation to ensure completion; also track vulnerabilities that you 
have determined not to remediate. This practice, RA.L2-3.11.3, benefits from CA.L2-3.12.2. RA.L2-3.11.3 allows remediation of 
vulnerabilities to take place based on the developed plans of actions for vulnerabilities from 
CA.L2-3.12.2. 
Example 
You are a system administrator. Each quarter you receive a list of vulnerabilities generated 
by your company’s vulnerability scanner [a]. You prioritize that list and note which 
vulnerabilities should be targeted as soon as possible as well as which vulnerabilities you 
can safely defer addressing at this time. You document the reasoning behind accepting the 
risk of the unremediated flaws and note to continue to monitor these vulnerabilities in case 
you need to revise the decision at a later date [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the results of risk assessments used to prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation [b]? 
 For any given vulnerability is action taken for remediation, acceptance, avoidance, or 
transference of the vulnerability risk [b]?66  
 Are all high risk vulnerabilities prioritized [b]?67

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations assess security controls in organizational systems and the environments in 
which those systems operate as part of the system development life cycle. Security controls 
are the safeguards or countermeasures organizations implement to satisfy security 
requirements. By assessing the implemented security controls, organizations determine if 
the security safeguards or countermeasures are in place and operating as intended. Security 
control assessments ensure that information security is built into organizational systems; 
identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; provide essential 
information needed to make risk-based decisions; and ensure compliance to vulnerability 
mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls as 
documented in system security plans. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed 
necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and 
whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and 
producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. Security 
assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of 
assessments being conducted. 
Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the 
determination of security control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of 
assessor independence. Organizations can choose to use other types of assessment activities 
such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of 
systems during the system life cycle. 
NIST SP 800-53 provides guidance on security and privacy controls for systems and 
organizations. SP 800-53A provides guidance on developing security assessment plans and 
conducting assessments. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Avoid a “set it and forget it” mentality when implementing security controls. The security 
landscape is constantly changing. Reassess existing controls at periodic intervals in order to 
validate their effectiveness in your environment. Set the assessment schedule according to 
organizational needs. Consider regulatory obligations and internal policies when assessing 
the controls. 
Outputs from security control assessments typically include: 
 documented assessment results; 
 proposed new controls, or updates to existing controls; 
 remediation plans; and 
 newly identified risks. 
This practice, CA.L2-3.12.1, which ensures determining security controls are implemented 
properly, promotes effective security assessments for organizational systems required by 
CA.L2-3.12.3. 
Example 
You are in charge of IT operations. You need to ensure that the security controls 
implemented within the system are achieving their objectives [b]. Taking the practices 
outlined in your SSP as a guide, you conduct annual written reviews of the security controls 
to ensure they meet your organization’s needs. When you find controls that do not meet 
requirements, you propose updated or new controls, develop a written implementation plan, 
document new risks, and execute the changes. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are security controls assessed at least annually [a]? 
 Is the output of the security controls assessment documented [b]?

responsibilities; personnel with information security responsibilities]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms for developing, implementing, and maintaining plan of action]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
The plan of action is a key document in the information security program. Organizations 
develop plans of action that describe how any unimplemented security requirements will be 
met and how any planned mitigations will be implemented. Organizations can document the 
system security plan and plan of action as separate or combined documents and in any 
chosen format. 
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as 
critical inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a 
system hosted by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an 
agreement or contract with the nonfederal organization. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
When you write a plan of action, define the clear goal or objective of the plan. You may 
include the following in the action plan:  ownership of who is accountable for ensuring the plan’s performance; 
 specific steps or milestones that are clear and actionable; 
 assigned responsibility for each step or milestone; 
 milestones to measure plan progress; and 
 completion dates. 
This practice, CA.L2-3.12.2, which ensures developing and implementing plans of action to 
correct and reduce vulnerabilities in systems, is driven by risk management practice 
RA.L2-3.11.1, which promotes periodically assessing risk to organizational systems. CA.L2-
3.12.2 promotes monitoring security controls on an ongoing basis as defined in practice 
CA.L2-3.12.3. 
Example 
As IT director, one of your duties is to develop action plans when you discover that your 
company is not meeting security requirements or when a security issue arises [b]. A recent 
vulnerability scan identified several items that need to be addressed so you develop a plan 
to fix them [b]. Your plan identifies the people responsible for fixing the issues, how to do it, 
and when the remediation will be completed [b]. You also define how to verify that the 
person responsible has fixed the vulnerability [b]. You document this in a plan of action that 
is updated as milestones are reached [b]. You have a separate resource review the 
modifications after they have been completed to ensure the plan has been implemented 
correctly [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is there an action plan to remediate identified weaknesses or deficiencies [a]?68 
 Is the action plan maintained as remediation is performed [b]?69 
 Does the action plan designate remediation dates and milestones for each item [c]?70

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, 
and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms 
continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and analyze security controls and 
information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. 
The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions 
by organizations. Providing access to security information on a continuing basis through 
reports or dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make effective and 
timely risk management decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to 
hardware, software, firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is 
further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide 
information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Monitoring 
requirements, including the need for specific monitoring, may also be referenced in other 
requirements. 
NIST SP 800-137 provides guidance on continuous monitoring. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Provide a plan for monitoring the state of security controls on a recurring basis that occurs 
more frequently than the periodic assessments discussed in CA.L2-3.12.1. This process 
provides a mechanism to assess the overall security posture of your organization, which 
directly relates to activities discussed in CA.L2-3.12.4. As a result, the process not only 
maintains awareness of vulnerabilities and threats, but it also informs management of the 
effectiveness of the security controls in determining if security controls are current and for 
management to make an acceptable risk decision. 
Example 
You are responsible for ensuring your company fulfills all cybersecurity requirements for its 
DoD contracts. You review those requirements and the security controls your company has 
put in place to meet them. You then create a plan to evaluate each control regularly over the 
next year. You mark several controls to be evaluated by a third-party security assessor. You 
assign other IT resources in the organization to evaluate controls within their area of 
responsibility. To ensure progress you establish recurring meetings with the accountable IT 
staff to assess continuous monitoring progress, review security information, evaluate risks 
from gaps in continuous monitoring, and produce reports for your management [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the security controls that need to be continuously monitored identified [a]? 
 Is the timeframe for continuous monitoring activities to support risk-based decision 
making defined [a]? 
 Is the output of continuous monitoring activities provided to stakeholders [a]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
System security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls. System 
security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls meet those security 
requirements, but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls. System security plans contain sufficient information to 
enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the 
plans and subsequent determinations of risk if the plan is implemented as intended. Security 
plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents 
including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of 
references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and 
implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This 
reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains 
security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to 
enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. 
Federal agencies may consider the submitted system security plans and plans of action as 
critical inputs to an overall risk management decision to process, store, or transmit CUI on a 
system hosted by a nonfederal organization and whether it is advisable to pursue an 
agreement or contract with the nonfederal organization. 
NIST SP 800-18 provides guidance on developing security plans. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A system security plan (SSP) is a document that outlines how an organization implements 
its security requirements. At a minimum, an SSP must include: 
 Description of the CMMC Assessment Scope as discussed in Error! Reference source 
not found.; 
 CMMC Assessment Scope Description: high-level description of the assets within the 
assessment scope; 
 Description of the Environment of Operation: physical surroundings in which an 
information system processes, stores, and transmits information; 
 Identified and Approved Security Requirements: requirements levied on an information 
system that are derived from applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, 
standards, instructions, regulations, procedures, or organizational mission/business 
case needs to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information 
being processed, stored, or transmitted; 
 Implementation Method for Security Requirements: description of how the identified 
and approved security requirements are implemented with the system or environment; 
 Connections and Relationships to Other Systems and Networks: description of related, 
dependent, and interconnected systems; and 
 Defined Frequency of Updates: typically at least annually. 
In addition to the requirements above, an SSP often includes: 
 general information system description: technical and functional description; 
 design philosophies: defense-in-depth strategies and allowed interfaces and network 
protocols; and 
 roles and responsibilities: description of the roles and responsibilities for key personnel, 
which may include the system owner, system custodian, authorizing officials, and other 
stakeholders 
This practice, CA.L2-3.12.4, which requires developing, documenting, and updating system 
security plans, promotes effective information security within organizational systems 
required by SC.L2-3.13.2, as well as other system and communications protection practices. 
Example 
You are in charge of system security. You develop an SSP and have senior leadership formally 
approve the document [a]. The SSP explains how your organization handles CUI and defines 
how that data is stored, transmitted, and protected [d,e]. The criteria outlined in the SSP is 
used to guide configuration of the network and other information resources to meet your 
company’s goals. Knowing that it is important to keep the SSP current, you establish a policy 
that requires a formal review and update of the SSP each year [g,h]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Do mechanisms exist to develop and periodically update an SSP [a,g]? 
 Are security requirements identified and approved by the designated authority as 
non-applicable documented [d]?

[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing boundary protection capability]. DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and 
by restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components 
include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and 
virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security 
architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected 
subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes 
restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed 
interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. 
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the 
implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services. 
Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and 
consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may 
also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission 
services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. NIST 
SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. NIST SP 800-125B provides 
guidance on security for virtualization technologies. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Fences, locks, badges, and key cards help keep non-employees out of your physical facilities. 
Similarly, your company’s IT network or system has boundaries that must be protected. 
Many companies use a web proxy and a firewall.  
When an employee uses a company computer to go to a website, a web proxy makes the 
request on the user’s behalf, looks at the web request, and decides if it should let the 
employee go to the website. 
A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and 
resources stored on the company’s network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet 
from passing through an outside “fence” to the company’s networks and information 
systems. Internal boundaries determine where data can flow, for instance a software 
development environment may have its own boundary controlling, monitoring, and 
protecting the data that can leave that boundary. 
You may want to monitor, control, or protect one part of the company network from another. 
This can also be accomplished with a firewall and limits the ability of attackers and 
disgruntled employees from entering sensitive parts of your internal network and causing 
damage. 
Example 
You are setting up the new network and want to keep your company’s information and 
resources safe. You start by sketching out a simple diagram that identifies the external 
boundary of your network and any internal boundaries that are needed [a,b]. The first piece 
of equipment you install is the firewall, a device to separate your internal network from the 
internet. The firewall also has a feature that allows you to block access to potentially 
malicious websites, and you configure that service as well [a,c,e,g]. Some of your coworkers 
complain that they cannot get onto certain websites [c,e,g]. You explain that the new network 
blocks websites that are known for spreading malware. The firewall sends you a daily digest 
of blocked activity so that you can monitor the system for attack trends [c,d]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 What are the external system boundary components that make up the entry and exit 
points for data flow (e.g., firewalls, gateways, cloud service boundaries), behind which all 
system components that handle regulated data are contained? What are the supporting 
system components necessary for the protection of regulated data [a]? 
 What are the internal system boundary components that make up the entry and exit 
points for key internal data flow (e.g., internal firewalls, routers, any devices that can 
bridge the connection between one segment of the system and another) that separate 
segments of the internal network – including devices that separate internal network 
segments such as development and production networks as well as a traditional 
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) at the edge of the network [b]? 
 Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries monitored 
(e.g., connections are logged and able to be reviewed, suspicious traffic generates alerts) 
[c,d]? 
 Is data traversing the external and internal system boundaries controlled such that 
connections are denied by default and only authorized connections are allowed [e,f]? 
 Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries protected 
(e.g., applying encryption when required or prudent, tunneling traffic as needed) [g,h]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred 
to as demilitarized zones (DMZs). DMZs are typically implemented with boundary control 
devices and techniques that include routers, gateways, firewalls, virtualization, or cloud-
based technologies. 
NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. SP 800-125B provides 
guidance on security for virtualization technologies. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Separate the publicly accessible systems from the internal systems that need to be protected. 
Do not place internal systems on the same network as the publicly accessible systems and 
block access by default from DMZ networks to internal networks. One method of accomplishing this is to create a DMZ network, which enhances security by 
providing public access to a specific set of resources while preventing connections from 
those resources to the rest of the IT environment. Some contractors achieve a similar result 
through the use of a cloud computing environment that is separated from the rest of the 
company’s infrastructure. 
Example 
The head of recruiting at your company wants to launch a website to post job openings and 
allow the public to download an application form [a]. After some discussion, your team 
realizes it needs to use a firewall to create a perimeter network to do this [b]. You host the 
server separately from the company’s internal network and make sure the network on which 
it resides is isolated with the proper firewall rules [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are any system components reachable by the public (e.g., internet-facing web servers, 
VPN gateways, publicly accessible cloud services) [a]? 
 Are publicly accessible system components on physically or logically separated 
subnetworks (e.g., isolated subnetworks using separate, dedicated VLAN segments such 
as DMZs) [b]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations apply systems security engineering principles to new development systems 
or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply systems 
security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, 
given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those 
systems. The application of systems security engineering concepts and principles helps to 
develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and system components and reduce the 
susceptibility of organizations to disruptions, hazards, and threats. Examples of these 
concepts and principles include developing layered protections; establishing security 
policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design; incorporating security 
requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical 
security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software; 
and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and 
patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk. Organizations 
that apply security engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of 
trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to 
acceptable levels; and make informed risk-management decisions. 
NIST SP 800-160-1 provides guidance on systems security engineering. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Familiarity with security engineering principles and their successful application to your 
infrastructure will increase the security of your environment. NIST SP 800-160 System 
Security Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of 
Trustworthy Secure Systems can serve as a source of security engineering and design 
principles. 
Decide which designs and principles to apply. Some will not be possible or appropriate for a 
given company or for specific systems or components. 
Designs and principles should be applied to policies and security standards. Starting with 
the baseline configuration, they should be extended through all layers of the technology 
stack (e.g., hardware, software, firmware) and throughout all the components of the 
infrastructure. The application of these chosen designs and principles should drive you 
towards a secure architecture with the required security capabilities and intrinsic behaviors 
present throughout the lifecycle of your technology. 
As legacy components age, it may become increasingly difficult for those components to meet 
security principles and requirements. This should factor into life-cycle decisions for those 
components (e.g., replacing legacy hardware, upgrading or re-writing software, upgrading 
run-time environments). 
Example 
You are responsible for developing strategies to protect data and harden your infrastructure. 
You are on a team responsible for performing a major upgrade to a legacy system. You refer 
to your documented security engineering principles [c]. Reviewing each, you decide which 
are appropriate and applicable [c]. You apply the chosen designs and principles when 
creating your design for the upgrade [f]. 
You document the security requirements for the software and hardware changes to ensure 
the principles are followed. You review the upgrade at critical points in the workflow to 
ensure the requirements are met. You assist in updating the policies covering the use of the 
upgraded system so user behavior stays aligned with the principles. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Does the organization have a defined system architecture [a,d]? 
 Are system security engineering principles applied in the specification, design, 
development and implementation of the systems [d,e,f]?71

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Separation of user functionality from system management functionality]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
System management functionality includes functions necessary to administer databases, 
network components, workstations, or servers, and typically requires privileged user access. 
The separation of user functionality from system management functionality is physical or 
logical. Organizations can implement separation of system management functionality from 
user functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different 
instances of operating systems, or different network addresses; virtualization techniques; or 
combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes 
web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any 
other system resources. Separation of system and user functionality may include isolating 
administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Prevent users and user services from accessing system management functionality on IT 
components (e.g., databases, network components, workstations, servers). This reduces the attack surface to those critical interfaces by limiting who can access and how they can be 
accessed. By separating the user functionality from system management functionality, the 
administrator or privileged functions are not available to the general user. 
The intent of this practice is to ensure: 
 general users are not permitted to perform system administration functions; and 
 system administrators only perform system administration functions from their 
privileged account. 
This can be accomplished using separation like VLANs or logical separation using strong 
access control methods. 
Example 
As a system administrator, you are responsible for managing a number of core systems. 
Policy prevents you from conducting any administration from the computer or system 
account you use for day-to-day work [a,b]. The servers you manage also are isolated from 
the main corporate network. To work with them you use a special unique account to connect 
to a “jump” server that has access to the systems you routinely administer. 
Potential Assessment Considerations

management-related functionality (e.g., to ensure that administration (e.g., privilege)

[SELECT FROM: Separation of user functionality from system management functionality]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
The control of information in shared system resources (e.g., registers, cache memory, main 
memory, hard disks) is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information 
protection. This requirement prevents information produced by the actions of prior users or 
roles (or the actions of processes acting on behalf of prior users or roles) from being available 
to any current users or roles (or current processes acting on behalf of current users or roles) 
that obtain access to shared system resources after those resources have been released back 
to the system. This requirement also applies to encrypted representations of information. 
This requirement does not address information remnants, which refers to residual 
representation of data that has been nominally deleted; covert channels (including storage 
or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow 
restrictions; or components within systems for which there are only single users or roles. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
No shared system resource, such as cache memory, hard disks, registers, or main memory 
may pass information from one user to another user. In other words, when objects are 
reused no residual information should exist on that object. This protects the confidentiality of the information. This is typically a feature provided by operating system and software 
vendors. 
Example 
You are a system administrator responsible for creating and deploying the system hardening 
procedures for your company’s computers. You ensure that the computer baselines include 
software patches to prevent attackers from exploiting flaws in the processor architecture to 
read data (e.g., the Meltdown and Spectre exploits). You also verify that the computer 
operating system is configured to prevent users from accessing other users’ folders [a].

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to inbound and outbound network communications traffic at the 
system boundary and at identified points within the system. A deny-all, permit-by-exception 
network communications traffic policy ensures that only those connections which are 
essential and approved are allowed. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Block all traffic entering and leaving the network, but permit specific traffic based on 
organizational policies, exceptions, or criteria. This process of permitting only authorized 
traffic to the network is called whitelisting and limits the number of unintentional 
connections to the network. 
This practice, SC.L2-3.13.6, requires a deny-all permit by exception approach for all network 
communications. In doing so, it adds specifics for SC.L1-3.13.1, which only requires 
monitoring, control, and protection of communication channels. Example 
You are setting up a new environment to house CUI. To properly isolate the CUI network, you 
install a firewall between it and other networks and set the firewall rules to deny all traffic 
[a]. You review each service and application that runs in the new environment and determine 
that you only need to allow http and https traffic outbound [b]. You test the functionality of 
the required services and make some needed adjustments, then comment each firewall rule 
so there is documentation of why it is required. You review the firewall rules on a regular 
basis to make sure no unauthorized changes were made. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are network communications traffic on relevant system components (e.g., host and 
network firewalls, routers, gateways) denied by default (e.g., configured with an implicit

Determine if: 
[a] remote devices are prevented from simultaneously establishing non-remote

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system 
resources such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling allows unauthorized 
external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of 
organizational information. This requirement is implemented in remote devices (e.g., 
notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets) through configuration settings to disable 
split tunneling in those devices, and by preventing configuration settings from being readily 
configurable by users. This requirement is implemented in the system by the detection of 
split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, 
and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Split tunneling for a remote user utilizes two connections: accessing resources on the 
internal network via a VPN and simultaneously accessing an external network such as a 
public network or the internet.  
Split tunneling presents a potential opportunity where an open unencrypted connection 
from a public network could allow an adversary to access resources on internal network. As 
a mitigation strategy, the split tunneling setting should be disabled on all devices so that all 
traffic, including traffic for external networks or the internet, goes through the VPN. 
Example 
You are a system administrator responsible for configuring the network to prevent remote 
users from using split tunneling. You review the configuration of remote user laptops. You 
discover that remote users are able to access files, email, database and other services 
through the VPN connection while also being able to print and access resources on their local 
network. You change the configuration settings for all company computers to disable split 
tunneling [a]. You test a laptop that has had the new hardening procedures applied and verify

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] cryptographic mechanisms intended to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI are 
identified; 
[b] alternative physical safeguards intended to prevent unauthorized disclosure of CUI are 
identified; and 
[c] either cryptographic mechanisms or alternative physical safeguards are implemented

[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Cryptographic mechanisms or mechanisms supporting or implementing 
transmission confidentiality; organizational processes for defining and implementing 
alternative physical safeguards]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to internal and external networks and any system components that 
can transmit information including servers, notebook computers, desktop computers, 
mobile devices, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines. Communication paths 
outside the physical protection of controlled boundaries are susceptible to both interception 
and modification. Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission 
services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which 
can be highly specialized to individual customer needs), may find it difficult to obtain the 
necessary assurances regarding the implementation of the controls for transmission 
confidentiality. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality 
services are available in commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary safeguards and assurances of the effectiveness of the 
safeguards 
through 
appropriate 
contracting 
vehicles, 
organizations 
implement 
compensating safeguards or explicitly accept the additional risk. An example of an 
alternative physical safeguard is a protected distribution system (PDS) where the 
distribution medium is protected against electronic or physical intercept, thereby ensuring 
the confidentiality of the information being transmitted. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The intent of this practice is to ensure CUI is cryptographically protected during transit, 
particularly on the internet. The most common way to accomplish this is to establish a TLS 
tunnel between the source and destination using the most current version of TLS. This 
practice does not specify a mutually authenticated handshake, but mutual authentication is 
the most secure approach to creating a tunnel. 
When CMMC requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. FIPS-validated 
cryptography means the cryptographic module has to have been tested and validated to 
meet FIPS 140-1 or-2 requirements. Simply using an approved algorithm is not sufficient – 
the module (software and/or hardware) used to implement the algorithm must be 
separately validated under FIPS 140. Accordingly, FIPS-validated cryptography is required 
to meet CMMC practices that protect CUI when transmitted or stored outside the protected 
environment of the covered contractor information system (including wireless/remote 
access). Encryption used for other purposes, such as within applications or devices within 
the protected environment of the covered contractor information system, would not need to 
be FIPS-validated. 
This practice, SC.L2-3.13.8, requires cryptographic mechanisms be used to prevent the 
disclosure of CUI in-transit and leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the algorithms 
used must be FIPS-validated. 
Example 
You are a system administrator responsible for configuring encryption on all devices that 
contain CUI. Because your users regularly store CUI on laptops and take them out of the 
office, you encrypt the hard drives with a FIPS-validated encryption tool built into the 
operating system. For users who need to share CUI, you install a Secure FTP server to allow 
CUI to be transmitted in a compliant manner [a]. You verify that the server is using a FIPS-
validated encryption module by checking the NIST Cryptographic Module Validation 
Program website [c]. You turn on the “FIPS Compliance” setting for the server during 
configuration because that is what is required for this product in order to use only FIPS-
validated cryptography [c].

during transmission unless otherwise protected by alternative physical measures (e.g., 
PDS) [c]?73

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] a period of inactivity to terminate network connections associated with 
communications sessions is defined; 
[b] network connections associated with communications sessions are terminated at the 
end of the sessions; and 
[c] network connections associated with communications sessions are terminated after the

[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security 
responsibilities; system developer]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing network disconnect capability]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
This requirement applies to internal and external networks. Terminating network 
connections associated with communications sessions include de-allocating associated 
TCP/IP address or port pairs at the operating system level, or de-allocating networking 
assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single, 
operating system-level network connection. Time periods of user inactivity may be 
established by organizations and include time periods by type of network access or for 
specific network accesses. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Prevent malicious actors from taking advantage of an open network session or an 
unattended computer at the end of the connection. Balance user work patterns and needs 
against security to determine the length of inactivity that will force a termination. 
This practice, SC.L2-3.13.9, requires network connections be terminated under certain 
conditions, which complements AC.L2-3.1.18 that requires control of mobile device 
connections. 
Example 
You are an administrator of a server that provides remote access. Your company’s policies 
state that network connections must be terminated after being idle for 60 minutes [a]. You 
edit the server configuration file and set the timeout to 60 minutes and restart the remote 
access software [c]. You test the software and verify that the connection is terminated 
appropriately. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the network connections requiring management and time-out for inactivity 
documented [a]? 
 Are the network connections requiring management and time-out for inactivity 
configured and implemented [c]?

systems. 
ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] cryptographic keys are established whenever cryptography is employed; and 
[b] cryptographic keys are managed whenever cryptography is employed. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures addressing 
cryptographic key establishment and management; system security plan; system design

responsibilities; personnel with responsibilities for cryptographic key establishment and 
management]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing cryptographic key establishment 
and management]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Cryptographic key management and establishment can be performed using manual 
procedures or mechanisms supported by manual procedures. Organizations define key 
management requirements in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, 
policies, directives, regulations, and standards specifying appropriate options, levels, and 
parameters. 
NIST SP 800-56A and NIST SP 800-57-1 provide guidance on cryptographic key management 
and key establishment. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Develop processes and technical mechanisms to protect the cryptographic keys’ 
confidentiality, authenticity, and authorized use in accordance with industry standards and 
regulations. Key management systems provide oversight, assurance, and the capability to 
demonstrate the cryptographic keys are created in a secure manner and protected from loss 
or misuse throughout their lifecycle (e.g., active, expired, revoked). For a small number of keys, this can be accomplished with manual procedures and mechanisms. As the number of 
keys and cryptographic units increase, automation and tool support will be required. 
The first intent of this practice is to ensure cryptographic keys are properly created in a 
secure manner that prevents them from being reproduced by an adversary. The second 
intent of this practice is to ensure cryptographic keys are managed in a secure manner that 
prevents them from being stolen by an adversary. 
Key establishment involves the creation of keys and coordination among parties that will use 
the keys of the methodology for generating the final keying material. This is discussed in 
detail in SP 800-56A, B, and C. 
Key management involves protecting keys when they are distributed, when they are stored, 
when they are being used, and when they are being recovered. 
Key establishment best practices are identified in NIST SP 800-56A, B, and C. Key 
management best practices are identified in NIST SP 800-57 Parts 1, 2, and 3.  
This practice, SC.L2-3.13.10, complements AC.L2-3.1.19 by specifying that any cryptographic 
keys in use must be protected. 
Example 1 
You are a system administrator responsible for providing key management. You have 
generated a public-private key pair to exchange CUI [a]. You require all system 
administrators to read the key management policy before you allow them to install the 
private key on their machines [b]. No one else is allowed to know or have a copy of the private 
key per the policy. You provide the public key to the other parties who will be sending you 
CUI and test the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the encryption is working [a]. You 
set a revocation period of one year on all your certificates per organizational policy [b]. 
Example 2 
You encrypt all of your company’s computers using the disk encryption utility built into the 
operating system. As you configure encryption on each device, it generates a cryptographic 
key. You associate each key with the correct computer in your inventory spreadsheet and 
restrict access to the spreadsheet to the system administrators whose work role requires 
them to manage the computers [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are cryptographic keys established whenever cryptography is employed (e.g., digital 
signatures, 
authentication, 
authorization, 
transport, 
or 
other 
cryptographic 
mechanisms) [a]? 
 Are cryptographic keys maintained whenever cryptography is employed (e.g., key

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Cryptography can be employed to support many security solutions including the protection 
of controlled unclassified information, the provision of digital signatures, and the 
enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary 
clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. 
Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation. 
Cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and/or NSA-approved 
cryptography. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
When CMMC requires cryptography, it is to protect the confidentiality of CUI. FIPS-validated 
cryptography means the cryptographic module has to have been tested and validated to

SC.L2-3.13.16 by specifying that FIPS-validated cryptography must be used. 
Example 
You are a system administrator responsible for deploying encryption on all devices that 
contain CUI. You must ensure that the encryption you use on the devices is FIPS-validated 
cryptography [a]. An employee informs you of a need to carry a large volume of CUI offsite 
and asks for guidance on how to do so. You provide the user with disk encryption software 
that you have verified via the NIST website that uses a CMVP-validated encryption module 
[a]. Once the encryption software is active, the user copies the CUI data onto the drive for 
transport.

 Is cryptography implemented to protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest and in transit, 
through the configuration of systems and applications or through the use of encryption 
tools [a]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing management of remote activation 
of collaborative computing devices; mechanisms providing an indication of use of 
collaborative computing devices]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Collaborative computing devices include networked white boards, cameras, and 
microphones. Indication of use includes signals to users when collaborative computing 
devices are activated. Dedicated video conferencing systems, which rely on one of the 
participants calling or connecting to the other party to activate the video conference, are 
excluded. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Notification that a device is in use can include an indicator light that turns on or a specific 
text window that appears on screen. If a device does not have the means to alert a user when in use, the organization should provide manual means. Manual means can include, as 
necessary: 
 paper notification on entryways; and 
 locking entryways when a collaborative computing device is in use. 
This practice is not intended to include technologies that enable users to share the contents 
of their computer screens via the internet. 
Example 
A group of remote employees at your company routinely collaborate using cameras and 
microphones attached to their computers [a]. To prevent the misuse of these devices, you 
disable the ability to turn on cameras or microphones remotely [c]. You ensure the machines 
alert users when the camera or microphone are in use with a light beside the camera and an 
onscreen notification [b]. Although remote activation is blocked, this enables users to see if 
the devices are active. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the collaborative computing devices configured to provide indication to users when 
in use (e.g., a light, text notification, or audio tone) or are users alerted before entering a 
space (e.g., written notice posted outside the space) where they are in use [b]? 
 Are the collaborative computing devices configured to prevent them from being turned 
on without user interaction or consent [c]?

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational process for controlling, authorizing, monitoring, and 
restricting mobile code; mechanisms supporting or implementing the management of 
mobile code; mechanisms supporting or implementing the monitoring of mobile code]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Mobile code technologies include Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Postscript, PDF, Flash animations, 
and VBScript. Decisions regarding the use of mobile code in organizational systems are based 
on the potential for the code to cause damage to the systems if used maliciously. Usage 
restrictions and implementation guidance apply to the selection and use of mobile code 
installed on servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations, 
notebook computers, and devices (e.g., smart phones). Mobile code policy and procedures 
address controlling or preventing the development, acquisition, or introduction of 
unacceptable mobile code in systems, including requiring mobile code to be digitally signed 
by a trusted source. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Ensure mobile code is authorized to execute in company systems only in accordance with 
policy and technical configuration, and that unauthorized mobile code is not. Monitor the use 
of mobile code through boundary devices (e.g., firewalls), audit logs, or security utilities (e.g., 
mobile device management, advanced endpoint protection) and implement remediation 
activities as needed. 
The first intent of this practice is to ensure the limits of mobile code usage and usage 
restrictions are documented and enforced. This includes documenting all authorizations for 
the use of mobile code and ensuring it is not used in other ways. Usage restrictions and 
implementation guidance apply to the selection and use of mobile code installed on servers 
and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations and devices to 
include all mobile devices and smart phones.  
The second intent is to monitor the use of mobile code and implement remediation steps if 
its use does not align with policy. 
Example 
Your company has decided to prohibit the use of Flash, ActiveX, and Java plug-ins for web 
browsers on all of its computers [a]. To enforce this policy you configure the computer 
baseline configuration to disable and deny the execution of mobile code [a]. You implement 
an exception process to re-enable mobile code execution only for those users with a 
legitimate business need [a]. 
One department complains that a web application they need to perform their job no longer 
works. You meet with them and verify that the web application uses ActiveX in the browser. 
You submit a change request with the Change Review Board. Once the change is approved, 
you reconfigure the department’s computers to allow the running of ActiveX in the browser. 
You also configure the company firewall to alert you if ActiveX is used by any website but the 
allowed one [b]. You set a reminder for yourself to check in with the department at the end 
of the year to verify they still need that web application. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are there defined limits of mobile code usage and established usage restrictions, which 
specifically authorize use of mobile code (e.g., Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, Flash, 
Shockwave, Postscript, VBScript) within the information system [a]?74

ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Determine if: 
[a] use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies is controlled; and 
[b] use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies is monitored. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures addressing

responsibilities; personnel with responsibilities for managing VoIP]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational process for authorizing, monitoring, and controlling VoIP; 
mechanisms supporting or implementing authorizing, monitoring, and controlling VoIP]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
VoIP has different requirements, features, functionality, availability, and service limitations 
when compared with the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) (i.e., the standard telephone 
service). In contrast, other telephone services are based on high-speed, digital 
communications lines, such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Fiber 
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). The main distinctions between POTS and non-POTS 
services are speed and bandwidth. To address the threats associated with VoIP, usage 
restrictions and implementation guidelines are based on the potential for the VoIP 
technology to cause damage to the system if it is used maliciously. Threats to VoIP are similar 
to those inherent with any Internet-based application. 
NIST SP 800-58 provides guidance on Voice Over IP Systems. FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Controlling VoIP technologies starts with establishing guidelines and enforcing the 
appropriate usage that is described in organizational policies. Monitoring should include the 
users’ activity for anything other than what is permitted and authorized and detection of 
insecure or unauthorized use of the VoIP technology. Security concerns for VoIP include 
eavesdropping on calls and using ID spoofing to impersonate trusted individuals. 
Selecting a solution that can encrypt VoIP traffic is helpful in maintaining the confidentiality 
and integrity of the voice data. 
Example 
You are a system administrator responsible for the VoIP system. You configure VoIP for new 
users after being notified that they have signed the Acceptable Use Policy for VoIP technology 
[a]. You verify that the VoIP solution is configured to use encryption and have enabled 
requirements for passwords on voice mailboxes and on phone extension management. You 
require phone system administrators to log in using multifactor authentication when 
managing the system [a]. You add the VoIP software to the list of applications that are 
patched monthly as needed [a,b]. Finally, you configure the VoIP system to send logs to your 
log aggregator so that they can be correlated with those from other systems and examined 
for signs of suspicious activity [b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are VoIP technologies (e.g., approved and managed products or solutions) that may or 
may not be used in the system defined [a]? 
 Is monitoring for unapproved VoIP technologies or unapproved use of the allowed VoIP 
solutions employed [b]?

[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security

Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing session authenticity] 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Authenticity protection includes protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks, session 
hijacking, and the insertion of false information into communications sessions. This 
requirement addresses communications protection at the session versus packet level (e.g., 
sessions in service-oriented architectures providing web-based services) and establishes 
grounds for confidence at both ends of communications sessions in ongoing identities of 
other parties and in the validity of information transmitted. 
NIST SP 800-77, NIST SP 800-95, and NIST SP 800-113 provide guidance on secure 
communications sessions. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
The intent of this practice is to ensure a trust relationship is established between both ends 
of a communication session. Each end can be assured that the other end is who it is supposed 
to be. This is often implemented using a mutual authentication handshake when the session 
is established, especially between devices. Session authenticity is usually provided by a 
security protocol enforced for a communication session. Choosing and enforcing a protocol 
will provide authenticity throughout a communications session. Example 
You are a system administrator responsible for ensuring that the two-factor user 
authentication mechanism for the servers is configured correctly. You purchase and 
maintain the digital certificate and replace it with a new one before the old one expires. You 
ensure the TLS configuration settings on the web servers, VPN solution, and other 
components that use TLS are correct, using secure settings that address risks against attacks 
on the encrypted sessions [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is a communications protocol used that ensures the sending and receiving parties do not 
change during a communications session [a]? 
 Are controls in place to validate the identities and information transmitted to protect 
against man-in-the-middle attacks, session hijacking, and insertion of false information 
into communications sessions [a]?

[a] the confidentiality of CUI at rest is protected. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System and communications protection policy; procedures addressing

[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security 
responsibilities; system developer]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms supporting or implementing confidentiality protections for 
information at rest]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is not in process or in transit 
and is located on storage devices as specific components of systems. The focus of protection 
at rest is not on the type of storage device or the frequency of access but rather the state of 
the information. Organizations can use different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality 
protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. 
Organizations may also use other controls including secure off-line storage in lieu of online 
storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved or 
continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
CUI at rest means information that is not moving through the network; typically this means 
data currently stored on hard drives, media, and mobile devices. Implement the necessary 
security controls to protect the confidentiality of CUI at rest. Although an approved 
encryption method protects data stored at rest, there are other technical and physical 
solutions. The methods chosen should depend on the environment and business needs. Implementing encryption for CUI is one approach to this practice, but it is not mandatory. 
Physical security is often employed to restrict access to CUI, particularly when it resides on 
servers within a company’s offices. Other approaches for protecting CUI include system-
related protections such as configurations and rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion 
detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content that eliminate 
attempts at exfiltration. You may also employ other security requirements including secure 
off-line storage. 
This practice, SC.L2-3.13.16, requires confidentially be provided for CUI at rest and 
complements MP.L2-3.8.9, which requires confidentially of CUI at backup storage locations. 
This practice, SC.L2-3.13.16, also leverages SC.L2-3.13.11, which specifies that the 
algorithms used must be FIPS-validated. 
Example 1 
Your company has a policy stating CUI must be protected at rest and you work to enforce 
that policy. You research Full Disk Encryption (FDE) products that meet the FIPS encryption 
requirement. After testing, you deploy the encryption to all computers to protect CUI at rest 
[a]. 
Example 2 
You have used encryption to protect the CUI on most of the computers at your company, but 
you have some devices that do not support encryption. You create a policy requiring these 
devices to be signed out when needed, stay in possession of the signer when checked out, 
and to be signed back in and locked up in a secured closet when the user is done with the 
device [a]. At the end of the day each Friday, you audit the sign-out sheet and make sure all 
devices are returned to the closet. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is the confidentiality of CUI at rest protected using encryption of storage devices and/or 
appropriate physical methods [a]?

Determine if: 
[a] the time within which to identify system flaws is specified; 
[b] system flaws are identified within the specified time frame; 
[c] the time within which to report system flaws is specified; 
[d] system flaws are reported within the specified time frame; 
[e] the time within which to correct system flaws is specified; and 
[f] system flaws are corrected within the specified time frame. 
POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-171A] 
Examine 
[SELECT FROM: System and information integrity policy; procedures addressing flaw 
remediation; procedures addressing configuration management; system security plan; list 
of flaws and vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system; list of recent security flaw 
remediation actions performed on the system (e.g., list of installed patches, service packs, 
hot fixes, and other software updates to correct system flaws); test results from the 
installation of software and firmware updates to correct system flaws; installation/change 
control records for security-relevant software and firmware updates; other relevant 
documents or records]. 
Interview 
[SELECT FROM: System or network administrators; personnel with information security 
responsibilities; personnel installing, configuring, and maintaining the system; personnel 
with responsibility for flaw remediation; personnel with configuration management 
responsibility]. 
Test 
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for identifying, reporting, and correcting system 
flaws; organizational process for installing software and firmware updates; mechanisms supporting or implementing reporting, and correcting system flaws; mechanisms supporting 
or implementing testing software and firmware updates]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws 
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to 
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates 
include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address 
flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response 
activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available 
resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in remediating flaws discovered in 
organizational systems. 
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware 
may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of 
the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require 
more testing than other types of remediation. NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch 
management technologies. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to remedy those flaws 
by releasing vulnerability information and updates to their software and firmware. 
Contractors must have a process to review relevant vendor notifications and updates about 
problems or weaknesses. After reviewing the information, the contractor must implement a 
patch management process that allows for software and firmware flaws to be fixed without 
adversely affecting the system functionality. Contractors must define the time frames within 
which flaws are identified, reported, and corrected for all systems. Contractors should 
consider purchasing support from their vendors to ensure timely access to updates. 
Example 
You know that software vendors typically release patches, service packs, hot fixes, etc. and 
want to make sure your software is up to date. You develop a policy that requires checking 
vendor websites for flaw notifications every week [a]. The policy further requires that those 
flaws be assessed for severity and patched on end-user computers once each week and 
servers once each month [c,e]. Consistent with that policy, you configure the system to check 
for updates weekly or daily depending on the criticality of the software [b,e]. Your team 
reviews available updates and implements the applicable ones according to the defined 
schedule [f]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is the time frame (e.g., a set number of days) within which system flaw identification 
activities (e.g., vulnerability scans, configuration scans, manual review) must be 
performed defined and documented [a]? 
 Are system flaws (e.g., vulnerabilities, misconfigurations) identified in accordance with 
the specified time frame [b]? 
 Is the time frame (e.g., a set number of days dependent on the assessed severity of a flaw) 
within which system flaws must be corrected defined and documented [e]? 
 Are system flaws (e.g., applied security patches, made configuration changes, or 
implemented workarounds or mitigations) corrected in accordance with the specified 
time frame [f]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Designated locations include system entry and exit points which may include firewalls, 
remote access servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, 
notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, 
Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using techniques 
such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage 
devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. 
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and 
reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or 
eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and 
comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of 
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also 
be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other 
types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. 
Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these 
situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices, 
configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring 
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions 
intended. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
A designated location may be a network device such as a firewall or an end user’s computer.  
Malicious code, which can be delivered by a range of means (e.g., email, removable media, or 
websites), includes the following: 
 virus – program designed to damage, steal information, change data, send email, show 
messages, or any combination of these things; 
 spyware – program designed to gather information about a person’s activity in secret 
when they click on a link, usually installed without the person knowing ;  
 trojan horse – type of malware made to look like legitimate software and used by cyber 
criminals to get access to a company’s systems; and 
 ransomware – type of malware that threatens to publish the contractor’s data or 
perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. 
Use anti-malware tools to stop or lessen the impact of malicious code. 
Example 
You are buying a new computer and want to protect your company’s information from 
viruses, spyware, etc. You buy and install anti-malware software [a,b]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are system components (e.g., workstations, servers, email gateways, mobile devices) for 
which malicious code protection must be provided identified and documented [a]?

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
Periodic scans of organizational systems and real-time scans of files from external sources 
can detect malicious code. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g., 
UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using 
techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable 
storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system 
vulnerabilities. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Use anti-malware software to scan for and identify viruses in your computer systems and 
determine how often scans are conducted. Real-time scans look at the system whenever new 
files are downloaded, opened, and saved. Periodic scans check previously saved files against 
updated malware information. 
Example 
You work with your company’s email provider to enable enhanced protections that will scan 
all attachments to identify and quarantine those that may be harmful prior to a user opening 
them [c]. In addition, you configure antivirus software on each computer to scan for 
malicious code every day [a,b]. The software also scans files that are downloaded or copied 
from removable media such as USB drives. It quarantines any suspicious files and notifies 
the security team [c].  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are files from media (e.g., USB drives, CD-ROM) included in the definition of external 
sources and are they being scanned [c]?

advisories, and directives; mechanisms supporting or implementing security directives]. 
DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
There are many publicly available sources of system security alerts and advisories. The 
United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) generates security alerts 
and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the federal government and in 
nonfederal organizations. Software vendors, subscription services, and relevant industry 
information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) may also provide security alerts and 
advisories. Examples of response actions include notifying relevant external organizations, for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service 
providers, and peer or supporting organizations. 
NIST SP 800-161 provides guidance on supply chain risk management. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Solicit and receive security alerts, advisories, and directives from reputable external 
organizations. Identify sources relevant to the industry and technology used by your 
company. Methods to receive alerts and advisories may include:  
 signing up for email distributions; 
 subscribing to RSS feeds; and 
 attending meetings. 
Review alerts and advisories for applicability as they are received. The frequency of the 
reviews should be based on the frequency of the alerts and advisories to ensure you have the 
most up-to-date information. 
External alerts and advisories may prompt you to generate internal security alerts, 
advisories, or directives, and share these with all personnel with a need-to-know. The 
individuals should assess the risk related to a given alert and act to respond as appropriate. 
Sometimes it may require a configuration update. Other times, the information may also 
require adjusting system architecture in order to thwart a threat described in an advisory. 
Example 
You monitor security advisories each week. You review the alert emails and online 
subscription service alerts to determine which ones apply [b]. You create a list of the 
applicable alerts and research what steps you need to take to address them. Next, you 
generate a plan that you review with your change management group so that the work can 
be scheduled [c]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are the responses to system security alerts and advisories identified in relation to the 
assessed severity of potential flaws (e.g., communicating with responsible personnel, 
initiating vulnerability scans, initiating system flaw remediation activities) [a]? 
 Are system security alerts and advisories addressed (e.g., assessing potential severity or 
likelihood, communicating with responsible personnel, initiating vulnerability scans,

supporting or implementing system monitoring capability; organizational processes for 
intrusion detection and system monitoring; mechanisms supporting or implementing the

DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 R2] 
System monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes 
the observation of events occurring at the system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense 
and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations can monitor systems, for example, by observing audit 
record activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, 
characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide 
determination of the events. System monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of 
tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, 
malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, 
network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected 
perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices 
being employed at managed system interfaces. The granularity of monitoring information 
collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to 
support such objectives. 
System monitoring is an integral part of continuous monitoring and incident response 
programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and 
incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that 
communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection 
is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the 
Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless. 
Unusual or unauthorized activities or conditions related to inbound/outbound 
communications traffic include internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code 
in systems or propagating among system components, the unauthorized exporting of 
information, or signaling to external systems. Evidence of malicious code is used to identify 
potentially compromised systems or system components. System monitoring requirements, 
including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other 
requirements. 
NIST SP 800-94 provides guidance on intrusion detection and prevention systems. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Think of indicators of attack as a set of footprints an adversary leaves during an attack. 
Indicators of attack provide information on the steps the adversary followed and its intent. 
Indicators of attacks on organizational systems may include: 
 internal traffic that indicates the presence of malicious code; 
 anomalous activity detected during non-business hours; 
 unauthorized data leaving the organization; and 
 communicating to external information systems. 
To detect attacks and indicators of attacks, deploy monitoring devices or agents. Place these 
sensors at strategic points within the systems and networks to collect essential information. 
Strategic points include internal and external system boundaries. Monitor both inbound 
traffic and outbound traffic as well as actions on hosts. 
This practice, SI.L2-3.14.6, provides details for the communications of organizational 
systems. SI.L2-3.14.6 supports the practice AU.L2-3.3.1, which involves creating and 
retaining records for monitoring, analysis, and investigations. 
Example 
It is your job to look for known indicators of attack or anomalous activity within your 
systems and communications traffic [a,b,c]. Because these indicators can show up in a variety 
of places on your network, you have created a checklist of places to check each week. These 
include the office firewall logs, the audit logs of the file server where CUI is stored, and the 
connection log for your VPN gateway [b]. 
You conduct additional reviews when you find an indicator, or something that does not 
perform as it should [a]. 
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Are details provided for the methodology of determining attacks and indicators of attack 
[a]? 
 Are monitoring devices deployed within the information system to collect information 
that may indicate an attack [a]? 
 Are communications traffic flows understood and is there a deployed capability to review 
that traffic [b,c]?

requirements. 
NIST SP 800-94 provides guidance on intrusion detection and prevention systems. 
FURTHER DISCUSSION 
Define authorized use of your systems. Create an acceptable use policy to establish the 
baseline for how users access devices, internal network services, and the internet. Define 
authorized use by specific roles such as: user, administrator, and technician. After authorized 
use is defined, identify unauthorized use of systems. 
Monitor systems by observing audit activities from the system logs. This can be 
accomplished in real time using automated solutions or by manual means. To identify 
unauthorized use, leverage existing tools and techniques, such as: 
 intrusion detection systems; 
 intrusion prevention systems; 
 malicious code protection software; 
 scanning tools; 
 audit record monitoring software; and 
 network monitoring software. 
This practice, SI.L2-3.14.7, which deals with identifying unauthorized use of organizational 
systems, is related to practices: AC.L1-3.1.1, AU.L2-3.3.1, IA.L1-3.5.1, and IA.L1-3.5.2. All of 
these practices help create the building blocks that support SI.L2-3.14.7. 
Example 1 
You are in charge of IT operations. You need to ensure that everyone using an organizational 
system is authorized to do so and conforms to the written authorized use policy. To do this, 
you deploy an application that monitors user activity and records the information for later 
analysis. You review the data from this application for signs of activity that does not conform 
to the acceptable use policy [a,b]. 
Example 2 
You are alerted through your Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that one of your users is 
connecting to a server that is from a high-risk domain (based on your commercial domain 
reputation service). You investigate and determine that it’s not the user, but instead an 
unauthorized connection attempt [b]. You add the domain to your list of blocked domains 
to prevent connections in the future.  
Potential Assessment Considerations 
 Is authorized use of systems defined (e.g., data types permitted for storage or processing, 
personnel authorized to access, times or days of permitted use, permitted software) [a]? 
 Is unauthorized use of systems defined (e.g., not authorized to use systems for bitcoin 
mining, not authorized for pornographic content, not authorized to access gambling 
games/content) [b]?
